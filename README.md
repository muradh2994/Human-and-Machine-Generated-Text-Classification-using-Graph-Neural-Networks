# Human-and-Machine-Generated-Text-Classification-using-Graph-Neural-Networks
In recent times, there has been a significant increase in the amount of text that are generated using machines. For example, chatbots are used to automatically generate chat replies for various customer services. Similarly various machine generated texts are used to promote false propaganda. Further, more recently transformer-based models trained on large corpuses are found to generate text identical to human written text. In such cases, it is important to distinguish between human and machine generated content to identify its authenticity. We propose in this project to investigate the application of graph neural networks to distinguish between human and machine generated text. More specifically, we propose to apply graph convolution networks to use the sentence structure to identify whether a given text is machine generated or human generated.
