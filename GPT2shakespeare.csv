 and i will live all my life in a state of mourning i shall not be content with the grave but i am sure of a great love for my wife for she has been the joy of my youth but she is a stranger to me than i have ever been if i may though i make my escape she will not find me in the house of happiness nor shall i think of finding her nor will i do so in my body if i can find her i must take care not to say such things about my soul as to avoid so much danger and yet i fear that my heart will be shaken by such a thing for i know that the lord will punish me for that which i say in like manner if my words offend the savior when i feel that i should be carried about in this way it is not for the sake of the world as i said that is when i suffer so great a loss not because i would have lost it as i was in life and death but on the contrary such as will perish be saved in hope because god is the one who will comfort them rather than that he would suffer such loss23 of the way to the resurrection the only way is that to be baptized the lord has commanded me to baptize my children even though they were dead so that they may receive the spirit now to this i answer by means of an answer which the church has given in the first place we must not deny that if we are baptized our bodies are destroyed since our souls are not in their bodies we are assured that our body will remain pure which leads us to believe that we have been created without gods plan therefore baptism is sufficient it is necessary to save us from the devil after that therefore what is required in order to receive baptism is to go to heaven and meet with a saviour you see however he cannot be found in heaven where is there no spirit he is in hell yet there is something in hell called the eternal lake or hell itself there is no human being who can obtain salvation from hell for god does not want to cause us any bodily destruction or destruction that which is created for us is all that remains this is why the father is called savant then the holy spirit comes,GPT2
 when youre in a game you dont have to worry about your stats or what your defense is and you can play anywherethe goal is to have your team playing at a high level but you want your players to be able to play in the best way possible this is a big aspect of the game and how were handling it which well talk about in more detail the goal of this game is not to win a championship its to give you a chance to make a difference thats the purpose of our game its about setting the tone for this generation we want our players and fans to know that they want to help us win that there are players out there that are helping and thats what we want what we need to get these guys to understand is that if we win this championship and we get to where we are right now we have a shot at playing in this league right away if we don i mean if this is what happened to us i don i think any of us want this to happen to anybody else rightim not going to let you talk a lot about how this team was built or how it developed because it was all built on two different players but lets take a moment and talk specifically about why the team is so bad you know this past season they played like a team that could barely win they were losing games lost close games on the other shoulder their defensive scheme wasnt working even when they would have won in their defense they were playing like one team their defense was getting sloppy so that was a major problem lets also talk to the fact that this offense started out as a runfirst offense where the receivers were running the playaction game with no coverage so that when this was going on the offense could have gotten to their quarterback and started getting creative with their coverage in the end what did it mean to start off the season as the no 1 receiver laughter it was just that we started off slow our receivers couldnt get that much time to move then we got to a point where they couldn we didnt score couldn in terms of their game plan there was no way we were going into this season how do you play a ball game it,GPT2
 this is the only scenario where hes had any successi think its a good plan i have been doing this for a really long time it takes a lot of time but once i find the right plan i think ill see it through he said im looking forward to our next game in minnesota next week and with a new coach,GPT2
 but it was enough for i had already seen it and i did not have to contend with the man who gave me the matter who had told me that he had a good opinion of what i would do or what he would make of it for he was an honest man a man of good sense and someone who was a gentleman not to say a parson an old manand yet the question was was i to go up in the clouds and search for him if i could not so that i might know where to look for the one who would speak to me that might be him who told the truth and that was the answer no i didnt even need to inquire about that question but now there was another answer tis not the way to be a fair man he said and not all that but they who are fair are all fair and the most fair men are the greatest for the worst are those who have no desire to meet the end those whom they can only wish to love and to fight with the ones who think only of the good as if they were all the best are not good the best of them are good men they are men who believe that is why i was not a very good man when i came to this land because i thought that the world would be better if people were no different from me that they would not be so i think because the only person who could love them would have been the poor man or the rich man because they could have any one they should have all which is not true what i have done is made a mockery of all things so that if you like take a look at what is happening in this country what we are talking about we have the same kinds of people in america we have those people who live on the lowest echelon of incomes in fact it is the people of this world who can look down on this of course unless they have a sense of shame or fear of doing what they are doing whether it be for personal glory or for political gain it is a pity that these people even if some of us love their own country and want nothing but to see it succeed do not know how to live in a country where we can not even feel our own to them it must,GPT2

 he made a vow to his son and to the whole country of europewe have had a year or so of war since the first war of the 18th century by the germans that the most recent war has been the one between two french provinces their armies though they were of a great strength were under the command of two captains of arms they were a very numerous and numerous body of troops all of them under their command the french were on their way to conquer the country and were thus compelled to abandon the army of england but the french seeing the great danger had the strength to surrender their land and go to war against the english so they marched on the british army which was to be called the royal navy to capture the city of york in an act of great force they seized the ship where it had been captured a thousand miles off on a ship which had sunk when they had had an opportunity of obtaining the help of several other vessels the greatest of which they found the harbour of london this was the second time that a french fleet had crossed the hudson bay and at four othe same time there was a battle between the two parties by which the enemy for the same reason was defeated it was in this battle that sir henry devereux was so severely wounded that he was not able to go back to ireland until the arrival of his nephew who was then his counsellor under sir john fyfe of oxford he soon died probably of thirst not being able at that time to return home a year later in the year 1775 sir george stokes earl of essex took sir charles taylor king of scotland under his command as his ambassador to london so that they could meet each other and make peace there was much rejoicing that day with a few hundred french servants men and women from all parts of france including the natives of that country mr stoke however being present at the meeting of all the officers of our army and admiral he did not take the opportunity to say much because he knew very well that there would be no peace in europe or at least not even peace with the indians of america except in that place where there were two nations one of whom was called america if you would like to know more of what,GPT2
 and the caesar of rome had his people to kill and he did it but there was no mercy to the people of that time he was punished for his crimes for what he had donebut when the roman army was attacked by the persians they put a force on the country the persian army defeated the christian troops which was on a mountain in the valley of the mountains where they had their camp for the men of those days were not allowed to go on without facing the romans nor could they enter so the christians put up a barricade the army of which they were the principal when they came to their knees and looked on there came a great noise then the soldiers of both sides started to fight there was an army that had been on its way but had left the place one of them was killed while the other was wounded they set fire to a bridge and destroyed it so that they could not cross the river meanwhile there were three thousand soldiers some of whom were killed all of these men were captured when they arrived in rome on receiving that news caesar sent for the jews who had come to him from egypt now how could the arabs be so foolish and so insolent when all that was going on was so easily made clear by this story,GPT2
yes and this that he was not the first to take a vow but afterwards as soon as he heard of the death of his father he took another not being sure what to do with it was he sent away to carthage where he came on the seventh day of september being at carthaginian time the romans have a long story to tell see here and here and that the following is the story of titus who was sent to rome at the time of christs coming if i may in some way be persuaded that this story is not true i will say that it is if you will not believe me by that of which it was said the lord will turn the hearts of men against you you shall not have them for your own endstitus tis a solemn vow to go to america to see the church of rome the home of all the saints which he hath set up in his house and this is a very important thing because when he went to the place where titus was born there was no one in the church for he had not even heard the gospel preached there the lord too called him by his first name so titus went there saying my name is titus and my name are hearkened to me you do not know titus did he not write his name with his handand titus came to philadelphia there was a man named john a soldier born on a certain day on that very day which was the day when god created the world he was called jesus or john this is his story and the next day he saw him having a mighty army marching against him this was his third day jesus told him to march and attack the enemy so he thought the whole army might be taken unless he ran for a little while after that when they had taken the army back one of them asked him what was wrong with the rest and he told them what he did and what the people had done then he said to them tell us what you did john and as john had been the leader of these people we have found out why they said that they were going to betray the christians they said they would fight them when they saw,GPT2

 but if you bow for safety and for the safety of others then they will make you a foolbut he was his own and he did not know that they might be his servants —he went forward to the gate and came to a gate that was open with a man of light standing by the side of the doorway come on come on said the man and stand up and stand to speak the whole crowd stood up as though they had come out of nowhere as if they were in the hall and the door was shut and at their feet the men and women stood round a very tall man with black hair and a very slender frame but who had a beautiful face a pleasant manner and was well dressed he was a young man about twentyfive years of age about six feet tall of thin complexion had an almost black coat and black boots was about three feet four inches in length looked very handsome very round and very large who was dressed in a great white silk dress and in very fine linen his hands were very clean and his feet were clean he had two large blackfurred hands holding a sword which he held with his right hand when he saw the sword in his fathers hand 1 thats the way they say for a thief 2  but if it were for any other reason i would have been a coward—he was called a jester and yet in what sense can we say that he is a jester we are not told what the meaning is how the word martyr is used here or how it is spelled the man said to him if i do this you will go on stealing and kill me so that i may have the last word of truth and he said and if he does the only thing he can there will be no more of him the crowd did as he spoke because the two men said that——and he went back to his house and said in reply to them there is no need for you to die for i have brought you the greatest of treasures what i am sure you have just as i want you you are a servant of god my servant i will bring that treasure back,GPT2

 the rest of that is he says of little importance and is of little value he speaks of the great difficulty of dealing with the spirit of an old man and of working to create and protect that spirit by bringing it into the world s s m smith a history of christian thought p 24the christian church however cannot be a source of this great spiritual force the church is a religious community a people of a certain disposition in the sense of being the people in the modern sense this is the church of god which is all the more because its members are the people not a group of people the bishops of modern times are christian scholars who are all men who hold some sacred law the church is a people not the holy spirit of christ but a great body of men of good will thus when the first baptist came to america and taught that god is god he was in no way an american he was not from england or scotland nor from india but his mission was to help the poor to redeem the land in a way that led men to salvation no christian scholar could have preached such a message in america for the catholic church was the only church of those who would have been able to speak it see a w miller the gospel of john pp 6 7 8 the catholic doctrine of jesus christ or christ had not been found among the christian sects though it was as we have said very common among some in europe a few years ago it became part of european christianity if this was a true doctrine then it must be found in all christian traditions we have the teachings of augustine of st paul st peter paul and st augustine in latin these have given us the most important of all of our christian confessions these are our most essential our greatest most valuable confessions it is true there is no biblical version of christianity that seems to make sense to the reader there is hardly any scientific definition of what christianity means although there are some catholic versions of it especially in our englishspeaking societies what is most striking in this regard is that the english church has,GPT2
 is not something which they possess but which in their own person they take to themselves the idea of a man in himself or of himself alone as a being of great power and a creature of greater greatness must be considered as an impious and absurd idea which has no existencebut if it were necessary to bring this to a conclusion it would be enough to say that in this connection are two men of such power and power what is more the former to be distinguished from the latter by their greatness and greatness and that when the first is distinguished that which is of greatest power is that of the greatest quality while the second is the property of all of these things because it is for their best interest for both men are of large and excellent qualities both are endowed with great virtues of immense power both are the true and the false neither are they alike of noble but of inferior rank but they are not alike with each other in the same spirit1 then this is what the philosophers call the platonic system for they say and the philosopher says that the soul is a good a perfect and perfect being who possesses the power of good and evil at last with the help of his own will can be made one of them if this be so then what part of our being do we play in it well we are as one with any other for we besides ourselves are capable of being good or evil we are all alike like this in those who have seen and heard there is one thing which ought to appear to you in a great multitude of cases even if this alone is impossible whether in fact it be good in itself or in others it is this therefore something we have made up to ourselves and what does it consist in it consists in our having a knowledge of that knowledge about which there are other things which must have been understood that knowledge is our own by being made a part part you mean to have a power in both parts since you have an understanding of both things here then is another thing to consider namely not that we can know the things of things by our will or by what we know yet that it may be said that our knowledge will be our power to know them whereas your knowledge may not be your power,GPT2
 to have a right of action to bring a charge of disorderly conduct and yet i am yet to hear it as you say you did bring it against me for i had no right to do itnow if you have not been at all familiar with the constitution of a state then you may be forgiven for thinking that it is not in the spirit of this constitution that you should be compelled to carry on the same business it is in fact the very act of the legislature i mean there is no law in this country which requires to be followed by you and then there are laws in another country which do not require to follow by but require us to obey them but i think you ought to know that laws such as this have been adopted by the states both for the protection of their citizens and for their own advantage they are in my opinion the only one which is worth protecting if you are of an opinion that the act is wrong i will give you a letter to the editor of the new york times where is it published wherein you can find out what has been said about this law we have already seen that when you take the law into consideration it will not be the case that they are not of any use unless they were created for a purpose of making an act there is therefore no reason that these laws should not by their nature be enacted the laws will be written into the state constitution by legislators for that purpose not for any purpose you will see that what i have said is true although you will say that some are for regulating whereas others are against it yet under the present constitution these men are obliged to conform to legislation whatever the cause may have to it in short they have so long been even before the establishment of our government so much in power without any real need for legislation and if they make a law any law is a natural consequence of it being enacted by them because it has no force of its own nor is any other law more than it could be so it would appear therefore what we have just said is that all the laws of states are now a very natural part of them but that no one being forced to adopt a certain law which they themselves believe is right can be trusted to make it the best law possible for it,GPT2

i got them all i got me all out no matter what it was all rightthe thing was coming back it was right there in front of me the air was a little more sweet and i could hear the drums and it would take a while for it to get over there but then i was back at it and they were coming and the girls were all running back and forth and everybody was running to them so i just kept walking back to the truck and ran over to it and then at one point i went over and grabbed the two girls and started running i stopped and saw a man walk up to me and put his hand up over my shoulder and said good night sirrah i knew i had to be there because i couldnt see any of them but i took off running and got up and went in then i heard the door open and there was the woman who was holding the girl that was in charge she was like oh thats my girl shes here i said to her you know what i dont want to lose her she said she had a boyfriend that night and that he was kind enough to put her up for adoption and im like ok now ive got to go get her cause i know she has to because i thought she was going to have to take off and get out on her own when she got there her boyfriend was out and he said im going back for him so she came back saying oh hes gone and so i started going over running back to everybody and running for her and she kept coming to my truck saying shed take her back with me that evening and then she said my boyfriends going be back so that i can be with her again or she can come and live with him and try to find another man for me or whatever just because anybody can go back that way doesnt mean that theyre not going out to meet me on the street tonight you cant just go out there and stay there with someone thats not who you are were all different weve all got different backgrounds and we all have different personalities if youre going into the world of prostitution you just come out here and do what you believe is best for society and for your family and your community in real,GPT2
 and i will tell them i am not here to be a liarthe fact that he was so keen on the word was of course a great help to him his own mind was not so easily diverted to his own ego he was always thinking about the whole world whether there was any or whether nothing was happening at all the only thing he could do was to look at the world and look for signs and cause but he never said because he had only to do that that it might happen to all the people he knew when he came to the place where the thing was going it seemed to me that a person was living in a place not just in his mind which was in the same state as the way it was so he went there to see see what i said and i saw him and he said i know that is impossible it is a little too real so then he started playing with himself sometimes he would say things to himself that were difficult and would not be very comfortable but he just continued on well then that means that the situation is perfectly acceptable we cannot be so far off from each other perhaps we should be able to understand each others minds thats something which i have always tried to improve upon now i think that if we can learn this from ourselves we will be better off if you cannot learn from yourselves you will never be good enough to succeed in your jobeunice johnsonwhen he finished he wrote this diarythats what it all ends up doing you have to realize that you are all a part of the problem now of course you have the opportunity to make your own decisions about what you do and do not do there are no limits on how you can accomplish anything with your life once youve been given that opportunity what will you try again what will not you be trying for if there is anything that can be done i promise that ill do it even if youre not certain you want to if theres some one youd like to come along with you who you love and respect there are people who will show up to give you that one do they know who theyre talking to you know what they want they will talk to you dont get me wrong they do cause,GPT2
i will leave it to you to decide whether the world will end up as we see it we have no choice but to keep our eyes on it and to make our voices heard if we do not reach our goal then we will not be able to see the true future but if we continue to work together we can achieve something and that is my goal i want to be clear about it we are not going to give up on our goals however it is hard for me to understand why we would want this to happen and why it would be necessary to do so that is because we have not worked out it is too difficult for us to let go of our dreams even if there are no plans and we may not even be ready there will be a time where we go forward without any of the things that are important to us the real problem is that we dont know whats going on so we cannot predict what will happen our current situation is a very difficult one how will we cope when we say we will never give in we mean that the only way we could survive is if our hearts were really willing to accept that when that can not happen what are we going through what will our lives look like in the future this is the final chapter of a series of essays that i have written for the american press association for more information please visit the website,GPT2
the man who has the most money is a man with a good record his reputation and wealth are a lot like the value of a book of poetry and a person who lives by a strict set of rules will never fail to get as much as he can the man that is most interested in riches is the man without a great record who is happy to make all his money and who always lives for some purpose a man needs nothing more than the best and most valuable things he knows about his own life as far as his wealth goes he is very rich he has a wealth of what he has acquired and does not care what his friends or neighbors think if he lives a very long life the people who think he should die are right to say that the future life is not for him but for people he loves thus it is only the life of the rich that matters,GPT2

 rest of my life i believe that my husband would have been the same if he had been there and if i had had him i think i could have done much for himi am glad i married him i hope i will not be disappointed my family is very much in love with me and i thank god that i have not been separated from him for a year he must have loved me a lot but i cannot remember what it was like it is strange though that in all my years i did not feel so close to him as much because i was so old and weak as if the world had not turned on me but in the meantime i find that he would love me for so much more than that we have now been married five months having only two children all in this town there was a time when he was the head of the town church which is still there when i remember that every year he goes to this church they are very near so that it is easy to see their relations the only time he has told me that they are close is when you see him in a little church or at a certain place and he says you might as well go there as at home i should like to get back to the subject of our marriage as i said before it would be a good idea to have a talk with him about my family if i were to do it he is a pretty young man from the village who has got into a great deal of trouble with his parents his aunt my aunts brotherinlaw a very nice old lady or the old man with the large hair this is all he wants she will take care of his needs she will help him with anything except for money then you know there are some things you will probably have to hear about if you have any reason to believe there is anything i can do for you when we were married we had a young woman named anna whose name was miss ann while she was in germany a man named hans the older of her two daughters told her that the last time we saw each other he wanted to go to a school anna said she knew what he meant to say that she is going to be the next person to learn english his wife was not interested in it hans,GPT2
 he was a very gentle and generous man and always showed respect to the farmer the farmer is not so kind as a man of his own i never heard a farmer give his permission for any of their property to be used but that of a horse a cow or any animal to which they are entitled all they have to do is to give a certain amount of money it is customary for a gentleman to have a large amount given to him which would include some of herding animals as well as hay wool corn etc which are all to one man mr r mbda 18741922 this was the period of great change in the farm and farming professions in some departments such as the bar the butcher cook miller wagner baker and so on there was much improvement in agriculture at the same time in some other departments such a change was less than in other areas due to some changes in their work such changes did not always involve a complete change a very large part of farming was directed towards the cultivation of plants and animals they were often done by very skilled farmers and the use of animals in this country made the work more efficient though the animals themselves were not as much of an object for example when a person was growing corn in a hounds yard he would draw a little bit of corn out of it and tie it to his hounds hoof but with some very special animals the food was so poor that the hogs would not be able to take it for themselves these were the first of many important changes on the other hand those who worked in many other fields were able and skilled at this there was no such large division between the skilled and the unqualified some of these professions were very numerous whereas others were so varied that it was hard to see what they were their work was not that different from those of other professions because they usually took on different occupations and had different pay many of them were employed in factories here was in every part that which was required to grow crops was very different very few were trained in any one of those professions that is they learned not much from their apprentices who were usually not yet in school also many of us were quite young at the time,GPT2
 wouldst not be there but would have been by the grace of god to be in like manner the church being in need of it has a right to the place where it is kept and no one is left in a place to whom it has been kept without being taken care of by a bishop or by any other person who may direct it18 this same doctrine of the church which we have quoted is found in the gospel of mark which has come to me by way of my fathers son whom i have spoken of in another place in which i refer to it again because i think i can now give it a more complete and proper name i shall explain the principles of this doctrine as i see what it ought to signify if i may without any errors on the very first day of lent the lord commanded me saying i should be not there to hear you speak lest you might be troubled at hearing that i had not been there and i looked up seeing that he was looking down upon me and i was not in my place so he lifted up his hand and said who shall speak my name and the angel of his god looked upon him and beholding him said unto him nay he said i will speak your name for he shall hear your voice so i heard him speak the name of jesus christ a name which is of that nature that the prophet isaiah had said it was the angel said to him again unto his lord tell me now when i am not here shall i be your servant for the man was in his place but he did not speak his name when he heard the voice of christ after that on the third day after which the bishop and all his authority was gathered together they were together at a great house where the apostles had gathered in one place and preached the gospel then they went and sat down to eat so that none could be seen except in some place that was already in their temple as they sat there while they ate it happened that there came to them the vision of a vision wherein the apostles were talking on both sides for they saw a man coming down from heaven whose name was john from the house of david he was clothed with a robe of gold and silver with white thread and a scarlet thread over which,GPT2
as for a few things the current version of the game as well as the previous ones are quite a bit longer than the version i used so it may take some time for the new ones to arrive hopefully this is something that we can talk about in the future though this may not be the last time well be talking about it for now im trying to keep my head up updatethe game has a number of interesting things going on it looks like you can use your characters to make better trades there are a lot of things you might not know about the economy of a city but youll have to learn how to use them to get the best deal of your character if you have enough experience you may even end up using the trade to improve your trade as mentioned above the two versions of world of warcraft are still being developed and are likely to differ a little bit making things a tad more polished than whats currently out there as for some things it seems like theres a lot going for players at least as far as i can tell with the current game being somewhat similar to the original this may change in a couple of ways depending on the feedback i get from the community even though i am not sure what the changes mean yettheres no official release date for world of warcraft which seems to have been delayed a good bit to ensure that all of its content is ready to go well see what happens with that when we have more game updates to share inif you enjoyed this article and would like to help out in getting this game out to everyone please consider giving a 5 donation to worldofwarcraft on patreon to support the development of this project,GPT2
 i stand up and cry out who is this who is the king of kings who has put these things into their hands for i am a man of many things and i will make them known to youthe king when he was asked by the people if he could be king for ever answered yes for i say as long as i live that i shall always be the one who reigns over them the true king who does what is right i hope that in the next hundred years i might become a prince and ruler over all the land of the earth for the greater the number of my people because of their greatness and their wealth they will become the rulers of all and if i would sit in my throne for many years then i ought to be able to make the same kings and rulers who have done so for all time but if a king does not be a ruler for long he cannot be ruled by a long period of time so long that he has to stand in his throne he cannot rule for so short a time and yet be truly an emperor the longer he is to keep his place in this kingdom it is because he does so as a father of men to be an emperor being an empire must be done through the generations no one can be ruler when his children are at school for a year and a half while his father is away a man who is a son of a great man and who holds the title of emperor is no emperor in any family his fathers name is not emperor but the name of his brother so long a person is an empire or a prince a king an empress his grandfather or his great grandfather this is what he holds it is one mans empire of this he must always stand if he wants to rule his people so many times but he goes on to lose his position and become emperor and never have a position again there will be war with him in order to win this war he needs to get as many children as he can as long he stays in power no one will dare to call him emperor this is why some say that the emperor can go on as his own even after such a period is over however after a certain period one or two people will still call emperor after this period when the time comes these people may say,GPT2

 donald the two leaders of the usbased group as well as several high profile republican politicians have reportedly threatened to use the campaign to get trump electedand as it stands trump has already secured a majority in the senate and he has even been forced to concede defeat to democratic challenger hillary clinton all of this has led to a trump presidency that has been described as a rigged election although according to recent polls hes actually more popular with the american people than clinton by a wide margin indeed one of trumps closest supporters former new york governor and republican presidential candidate jeb bush recently told the guardian that he supports the election of a republican president he added i think the real answer is to keep the economy going because as long as theres an economy people are going to be happy who has yet to take office will be the first us president to win a general election the republican party does not yet have a convention but it will likely be held in washington dc in early may with a huge turnout of more than 60 percent according the washington post this will ensure that trump will not be able to defeat clinton in november which means that the race to replace trump in office will begin with an extremely close race that will create a lot of problems for both parties since trump is going into the convention with much more power than his campaign has and will have more leverage than hillary it will also make trump the only major party nominee in us history to lose in a presidential election in which only one party has won a major presidential nomination since 1787,GPT2
 parts do not it is true that the latter have greater power over the former but that power as it were is not of any use to either of themthe same can be said for the second part for if there is any thing as great a difference between the two parts as between them it is that they both have a different nature and that nature is the same as that which distinguishes the parts this is plain from the fact that there are two different things as the matter of the difference and of its difference i will show that this is clear for it seems to me that in this case there will be no reason why the differences of two things should not be distinct as well as in the case of one these things are the causes not the effects the cause is that in order to be affected something is to have been removed from one way of saying that it was removed but the effect is of no use since it has no effect because it does not take the form of an effect in no case is there any effect of a change except in those things which are affected wherefore it must be evident from this which the reason of this argument is if it be observed that a thing when removed must have come into being whether or not it will exist if it are removed and how is this possible the effect does come in through the removal of it or through that of that removed one of which it may be a result by the use of another or by any other means either as a consequence of some change or as an event and if on the contrary a part of something which is also a cause of change should come to exist in some other way then being moved by some effect or effect upon it in that way or the cause thereof what consequence would it present how then can it not come there without some act or other of being changedchapter xxii what is an accident 1 it occurs let us consider the accident there is a great change of course of action from which a person is born to which his character is changed we should find that those that have the possession of such a possession are born and die with that possession not being destroyed by them or being taken from them for use by others now let us inquire whether the circumstances of man,GPT2

 and the whole army was moved in the direction of his majestys capitalthe second day the queen and her guards which were on a visit from her majesty arrived at york after their arrival they were accompanied by her husband whose arrival at the armyhouse on this occasion was a long one coming forth a short time before the days end had been the occasion for his departure when a great many of the kings sons and their officers were gone the king who was in a state of great anxiety at this time was very anxious to see his brothers death for there was much lamentation for the death of a man who had so long been so unruly that his own family in his view should be killed especially his parents and the most lamentable cause of this lamentant condition was that of another of those who wished to keep the kingdom in peace to the great effect that it would be so in the meantime some young people among whom were very young children were being sent to that country to seek to make peace with the kings kingdom this was an excellent opportunity for their fathers desire as he had the advantage of having the influence that was with him there but on hearing that the people were in such discontent he sent his son whom he called clyde to go to york and tell him who the cause was which was so frequently heard of such a very dreadful thing as the loss of an illfitting gown his uncles and his sisters her uncle being killed in battle with his wife in captivity while his father was confined in prison and on his arrival he was sent with instructions to return with such presents as were to be given him together with a few other things he desired to give him accordingly there arose a commotion among them not dissimilar to those which had arisen in those days but in which the young officers seeing that there were many men men of good character young women all who followed in their families took him in as their guest at the same time the prince being anxious that he might not be in danger sent a messenger to acquaint the soldiers of that army with what had happened a very few persons were sent in that assembly to come forward and make a report of what happened to their own people they were asked to enter into a treaty,GPT2
 we are to be governed according to the will of our forefathers i am not a dictator but if we be able to do that it is because we have done our duty it is our law my lord let us not give up our right to govern ourselvesnow we say that your right is to decide whether or not you want to go on the road to liberty in the country or whether you are willing to run on that road that is why you have to take the steps necessary to establish liberty and to carry it to your own benefit you have no right not only to choose which road you choose but to keep the other roads open for you this is your duty your liberty if you do not you will not have liberty but if you succeed in your endeavor then you shall have it for your benefit if not for yours and if on your deathbed the power of the state is not exercised that power is lost and if it does not lose no state can do any thing that is contrary to its will nor can it pass a law that does something contrary in its power for nothing is more certain than that the laws of nature will be followed by an entire people whether they are of a similar nature or different ones that they will keep their own laws in their hands or that we should never have the right of regulating their affairs any more than we had the rights of an individuals estate when he had died if he lived he lost his right his liberty to live because he did not wish to die therefore what you say to me is true is that this is the law of god for even though you think that god does whatever he wills to his will in our affairs according as he thinks fit he has not the authority to enforce his wishes in this country he is indeed a jealous god who has never been able under the circumstances to accomplish the things he pleases the power to punish others and punish those who do wrong is a power which is held by the almighty to have a monopoly in his own power see exodus 221012 deuteronomy 91920 the lord says for if anyone having been appointed to a place of authority can fail to provide the necessities of life for his posterity,GPT2

 his faith in youhe will have nothing but the utmost respect for you but on the contrary he will be so anxious to be revenged upon you that you will in spite of your greatest efforts be unable to persuade him to abandon you to the people of god for if he should succeed in convincing him of the necessity of renouncing you and embracing his son and be forced to accept the same for himself you would be very much obliged to pay him a great debt as to which your son would have none for it is as though he would with the greatest difficulty refuse to take care of you if your father did not like it but though this is the case hector is able to convince his father that the cause of his death is not of a nature which should be regarded as a sacrifice but as of an obligation which ought to have been made upon him for his own sake he will therefore say o man forgive me for what i have done to you and the reason he says you are so miserable is that he has not taken care to do so so he is going to say that to him who has never been so kind as he was there is no virtue save by the love of him whom you have made him who is all the more devoted to what he truly loves and therefore let him say the following if i had gone my father would never have known me i should have gone to a place where i was safe and in a more perfect condition and i would love myself better than i did therefore come take me up to your bedside and tell me what you think if you dont give me a better life it will become a burden for me so that i will not be able after the death of my grandfather to give you a good one you will give it to me by all means it is better for your life than mine for mine —that is to go on to this i have never given you any good or any hope at all this is a fact that no one can deny because it cannot be denied that it has happened to us the only good which can be given to our children is in their own selfinterest which is their true self not that of us or of any other as for my family their,GPT2

 he gives the name of god to the lord and in the bible he speaks of the resurrection of christ but in christianity it is the nature of things that they must be like a garment of garments or a curtain of shadows for the people to see the light of day and thus this is what we have seen in the new testament we see that christ was the one who was crucified not the other way around the people believe that he was in a state of eternal life but that his life was at the end of a short time what do these people mean by end of short the bible says that we are saved through the grace of jesus christ the son of man who came to save us by the power of his own spirit when we read in matthew and luke the story of an angel who told the prophets of old i am the voice of your father we shall see he is not a man of flesh and blood to the same end he came down into heaven saying o lord of hosts i am your god my godhead your son your godbearer he said my god i will make the world a little more perfect to make it a better place for my father by your grace which is in heaven above i do not say that i have come down from heaven to dwell in you because i came from the father however he came also down to earth so that the whole world may be the glory of my spirit as god himself said in his holy bible revelation 192— and he gave his only begotten son unto me a living god and he gave our father to us whom he raised from a dead man so our lord jesus was begot and the angel when he spoke said to him come let us go and worship him for i believe in him then the great multitude of people came together all the angels of heaven and earth jesus said unto them let us come come unto the kingdom of heaven whereof i go these were the names of all things therefore i say to you that you are justified by faith behold it was said amongst you in this life thou shalt not enter into the kingdom of israel it is written that if you go unto him where the spirit of his will is you will come to,GPT2

 not only is this a huge achievement but the amount of gold pieces scattered throughout the ground its also a great way to catch a glimpse of a future or future of the game as you play through each level you will notice that there are no new items to keep track of the items you collect are always available with over 500 items scattered across the map players will find ways to trade and collect them as they goplayers can earn medals for achievement points which are stored in the inventory for the next level when you complete a level you earn gold for those points but you have to earn more to reach the end this is a nice twist on the gold system however while its very rewarding to have a medal in your inventory it can also be very frustrating to get no medals you can save your medals to save time and also take them with you players will often find that the most important thing is to collect as many medals as possible the games biggest weakness is that it lacks the rewards that you would find in other games while your achievements are easy to obtain they can be quite difficult to find in this case however i found it to be the best way of collecting the medals i had collected all of my medals were bought in an online game so im only concerned about collecting them i cant wait to play the new game,GPT2

 the king had a great deal to gain in his own life which he had no desire of acquiring for he was not in the habit of doing so he was however very anxious that he might as he thought give up his present position and that the king might thus be able to enjoy his fortunethe king was very much in love with his wife who was a daughter of his father the duke of norfolk a citizen of england from whom he obtained a son of whom the name of king henry viii was derived but when he took to his court he found himself a subject of great anxiety in which the court of charles i had been a very poor and very very illregulated house his wife was unhappy when while trying to make herself of a man she was taken away to some private place where she could be found only by the use of an englishman this man was sir john green an old gentleman and a distinguished politician so that no one would say that his reputation was at the service of any except for all the great and the most distinguished to whom if they were to be believed his political reputation would be very well known on the other hand though he did not give his life to this yet he kept his head and his hand in a good and strong manner by which his name would not be tarnished since he never gave his son to any one who did so nor did he take any other man from his house to take his place when his daughter that is to say went to see him her eyes were not closed or her expression was like an airy smile with the air of hope having been made over her she was quite contented with herself because her father was her son but he being in great fear was content to give her to her mother whom she loved so that she went away not to meet him again under the pretext that it might be her will to go there then having found the place that would allow her a greater share of it they left the house leaving him alone here too there was no hope of escape no hopes of success and so they went on to the town until they come to a place where there are no men there till at last they came to an inn in one of them called,GPT2

 to be the cause of this it is the reason that the people of syria want to overthrow president bashar alassad and they want him to go and live but they do not want a democracy and they seek to make the government go in order to get it to do somethingand you know we are now seeing the same kind of behavior in syria in the form of mass arrests and arrests why if they are not acting why are they not doing this why are we not seeing this in many of these countries and what are the repercussions if we do continue to continue this what will we see in this situation we have to think about what we can do to take this to a whole new level that is will you not take the time to listen to people who are saying this is not acceptable and you will not listen and say you know what i dont care what you say im going to follow your example and take it out of it if you look at my record this was a time when i was president not a moment in my life when we were fighting a war where i didnt know who was fighting us where i knew who it was coming from this was not what happened people were saying things like we are fighting terrorism they should be killed and that was what they were talking about they were not talking at all about the fact that that is what is happening in our country these are people that are trying to destroy our state we are seeing it in every country in existence you know why because were living in a society where we live in fear and we want the police and prosecutors to see us as individuals against each other so our goal is to prevent that the only way that we will stop it is if the american people vote to reject it or if at the end of the day thats what the president said,GPT2

 that it may be used for this purposeps i think ive been told that the reason the game is a little different from the first one is because im a sucker for the action its not a good idea to play as a hero to stand in the way of the enemy making a mistake the game has been made more interesting by the fact that you can play it without having to rely on any character and the new features in addition to that allow you to go in and out of combat in a more natural way youre not forced to look around and try to kill people as i said all of this is not about the story its about what the characters and their motivations are and if youre going to make a game thats going for a new audience of players you have to put people first so id like to think that this would mean something to more people in terms of how this game this new game youve all been dreaming up just now is going in,GPT2
he can only be the one who can do this or else how could he the one that could do it1 the question is not what can he do but what can the individual do 2 if a person is able to do something even without being able then it should be possible to be able but if one does not have the ability to act it is because one needs to perform something the answer must not be but a simple yes or no answer i think this is an important point as a matter of fact one could not give a correct answer to the question since one would have to ask why dont you answer the same question every time or the obvious i don think so but if you asked why dont i do that you would be asking why don i do all sorts of things no matter it means that one is free to think what one wants to you cant tell an individual from another nor can one explain an entire story that is why the answer is often always and always correct it is the person who is asked who has the capacity to answer the other person whose capacity is as i said to say a yes and no because they all have capacity they all also have this capacity so that it will be impossible for one to express something in this way if some individual does this to himself he does it to others because he has capacity for this he is a free man this capacity in fact is what allows him to know what is true and what doesnt that is to put it briefly there are of course other ways in which capacity can be expressed which are not directly related to intelligence in fact we will show how to see what capacity the capacities of each individual can give one when that individual gives a specific answer well it has to mean yes there is something about the human mind right how can we know this because we can is we can what is this knowledge this knowing it can by definition be a power a power that can power when exercised by a man is his capacity of giving what he can and thus of seeing what his ,GPT2

 has always been a thing of beauty the beauty of indian women is not so much in the beauty as in their beauty—this is what makes them beautifulin the 18th century women were not allowed to wear skirts around their necks they had to shave their heads and if they were allowed their hair was cut short too but even in this day of modernity even if you cant see through the veil you still can see a woman to her right this is the first time in american history that a natural woman was allowed in public it was a moment that was lost on many americans at the time it was thought that wearing skirts was simply a way to make up for the fact that women wear a very narrow skirt in fact wearing a skirt allowed women to have a much larger range of looks than men so people just started wearing the skirts we then began to see it in america where people were able to show they had a lot in common with indian men while it wasnt always all that common now there are many indian tribes still with the very strict rules that no man can wear the same skirt as other men in any other community and yet i think weve become quite an accepted cultural institution in our country im not saying theres no indian culture in say los angeles or san francisco there are certainly many however that doesnt mean that there werent other indian cultures in those parts even as men were getting married the women of those communities were still marrying if you look at the history of the tribes in that period they weren as ive said before extremely backward on certain things for example when i was in college one of my friends was married to a british man but he was still married he was on his own you were married for a couple of years then just to be clear he didnt have any children people just assumed that he had children because of his being married and his desire to stay married after that thats never happened after his marriage his wife began having a really bad relationship with him she never got a divorce so it still doesns when youre married in an american settlement for example on a farm if id been married at a time when there was more women in society my family would have been very hard,GPT2

criminaljustice reform is a great idea for people in our country we need to get these kids out of jail and into law school but no one is willing to take the time and effort to help those kids its not easy and we need a system that gives them the resources they need what i think is the most important thing is for states to start having a conversation about this idea and start to look at it as a way of encouraging people that are in prison to come to the united states just like the americans who are here today to join the community those are the people who have been there they are young people they are people of color and they have the opportunity to do a lot of good so lets do something about itthe new york times josh rogin and the new yorkers david remnick on the presidential election a year after a string of republican attacks on mr trump the gop is still trying to convince itself that it is going to win again the election is now a foregone conclusion a year ago republicans won both the house and senate but no president since richard nixon has won the presidency even the president who lost the popular vote donald trump — its a long shot if you take his word for it — may have won more votes in november than any other president in american history the times… emphasis added were not just going in to attack one candidate and get into a fight the president by the way is running with the american people hes running on a platform of economic growth security for our citizens prosperity opportunity our safety a sense that he understands what this country needs to achieve thats why hes chosen to run against somebody whos been talking about economic nationalism for a year …  nyt  the times  the washington posts matt lauer on trumps victory theres no reason to be alarmed theres nothing we can do to stop him on immigration obama said we need more time trump im not worried im going home the post the first two weeks of the administration have produced a series of changes that have in the case of mr trump made things more,GPT2

 many kilometers then they will know that they are in the same vicinitythe idea is that the radius of an object is defined by its velocity it is the distance that is more or less perpendicular to the center of the object that determines the velocity of that object the second factor is its length an object travels faster than one kilometer if the angle between the two is greater than the speed of light it can travel faster since the light rays are perpendicular and the acceleration of them is constant they can be detected they can also be observed with a long distance a particle with the power of gravity is traveling at the rate of one meter per second this makes it very difficult to detect a largescale particle however the particle can move at an extremely fast rate and it is called a velocity vector another way to define velocity vectors is by using the mass and velocity units of a particle but this method is not very useful for the purpose velocity vector is determined by the relative velocities of particles and gravitational forces for example for a light particle of mass 1000634 this is a mass that can only be found at a distance of about one second from the centre of this object because the gravitational force is inversely proportional to its distance from this particles centre so if the weight of 13 m is equal to that of 22 m a projectile velocity can reach a point at which the energy of two moving particles is 56 m in other words one velocity is 1 ms,GPT2
 and much more the most illustrious of the four who were the masters of his people and the last of all who was the father of louis xiv the great emperor the first to be born in paris a very illustrious man very rich with the best education as well as the least education in francewe know from the french that the kings name was lameron which means the best and most brilliant man and probably because he was a child of a noble family he was born to the same family as is the case in many other places but this is not the only circumstance which renders it certain that he being born at rouen was from a country of great importance to king louis but the fact which makes it so certain is that at that time when it was called louis he lived in a town of so great a weight not only with his family some of whom had to live in cities of such importance others in towns of less importance that in that town there was no king who could not make a treaty with france by which he could have the honour of being emperor so that it is certain from all accounts given to him by the king how to make peace with louis this was in fact the reason that when the duke of marne came to france in november 1714 his son charles of that name would according to some accounts of events join him at the banquet of paris but he would not do it because having been ordered to do so by his master this man was very ignorant of what was going to happen so upon the advice of charles himself they went to paris and married making a great deal of trouble and after a long journey going back again to roue and having found a place where they could be married again made a further visit to louis house where he had found the wife of one of those who had joined him under the charge of king charles having come to that place it became evident to them on seeing the place being very small that the marriage might not be done charles and this though the couple were all so well pleased with a certain woman whom they called javier they were very soon in love with the second marriage was also made at which time louis was quite in great need,GPT2

 this is the first of two parts of a great book the first is our understanding of the political world in our day and our sense of how it has developed over the past forty years i am not the author of this book nor am i the expert on the subject but i shall present it here as a means of understanding the situation which exists in the world today a few words about the booki am a professor of political science at the university of wisconsin at madison my research focuses on a wide range of problems in politics and society it is my personal view that the problem involves the politics of individual interests not of ones own political views as a political scientist i consider the question of what is true and what lies behind the decisions of each of usin order to understand the economic system which is in development today you must understand what makes it work you must see that this system is an economic one without a social one therefore there is no need to view the economy or the social system as anything other than a combination of economic activities in fact the two are quite different things for example one sees the whole of society as an accumulation of income from which one can collect capital in the capitalist economy in contrast a part of it is produced by labor and capital both of which are responsible for the production of wealth on the making of socialism p 56,GPT2
 i would not take them now let us take thy own house and let it be a house of my own which is to say of the house which hath a dwelling in it i have spoken in my heart let thy house be the dwelling of thee and let thy son be thy dwelling that it may be your dwelling3 so then if a mans house is the only dwelling wherein he has a living it is because he is an heir to it but his house shall not be his dwelling for it shall be for him only that he will be an inheritance for the kingdom of god is for his inheritance so also if he hath no house to his own and no dwelling to the man then his home is not his abode this therefore is his place if his son who is a son of mine is taken and taken from my house by the father he shall go to my abbey as the lord commanded me to do and his wife shall give him a home in which to dwell where the land shall bear his name therefore when he comes out of his kingdom his father shall call upon him that hath given him this inheritance of land and of thy name to give his heir his land so that the world may have a name and not a king then shall he bear the name of a prince the son whom i shall carry tomorrow without the king having any other name than that of king nor shall i bear to any man without his due or shall my father and i share in any of those things which are not due to him thus shall it appear in his heart if thou wilt bear as thou art wont i will bear you thy inheritance that is on my name if thou shallest bear one that shallnt bear my son shall take him of me then shall a kingdom be given thee by my mouth with the word of your lord in the city of jerusalem upon the third day of december but not in this year lest thou shouldst be lost in thy kingdom but if thy people shall say to thee my god thou hast not given us this word thou shalt not give us anything not that thou mightest do so for if any one of them shall come to you do not believe that i am thy servant unless thou hast a good word to speak,GPT2
now in the next chapter i will go on to explore the different positions of the various parties in relation to the present session as you might expect the latter position has been taken by various factions and leaders to have been the main force in their support for the restoration of freedom of speech and expression in turkey it seems to me that although each faction is now playing its role of defending the individual it is not acting for itself in this respect this is a good example of how the party of an established party can be seen as acting on behalf of its own interests the party which is acting as a defender of human rights is that of a party opposing the establishment of state power this is because it wants to preserve the rule of law and not to be regarded as an independent party by this we can say that the ruling party in this country is the new right as i call it and thus does not belong to any of these three parties but to a certain extent there are also parties that do not wish to participate in public events such as the akp or the nationalist party which while seeking to advance certain objectives do so because they believe that they are not the only ones and i can understand this for example after the 9 august massacres and the pkks attempt to overthrow the government members of other parties openly expressed their hope that their party would be a member of parliament some of them were but most of those who were not members never expressed such a hope they were simply expressing their fear of being called out by the authorities after the massacres they left their own party their political party and no political parties to fight for a kurdish independence now a similar situation occurred when the turkish government issued a decree declaring that the right to speak read write be in communication with or hold any political or religious beliefs is prohibited the people as i have seen are willing to defend these things what matters is what they want these are the reasons why they choose to join the kurdish parties and fight in kurdistan that is why we have to look at their actions in terms of what constitutes an individuals right to express their ideas and ideas i am going to examine the role for these parties actions and their ideology when i say ideological i dont mean political but rather this,GPT2

 have been a fool to be tempted to sacrifice myself to this man and at the same time to believe that he was worthy of the power that i had at my disposalit was not until a few days later that the man who had been at her door had taken her off she was bleeding profusely but was being treated with utmost care with the help of many other people he had at least brought the two women who were in her bed along with a large quantity of water to her the first two were to take her to the hospital for various reasons they said as they did not want to hurt her or give her any comfort which she did by herself but the third because she had kept herself from being sick was so intoxicated with fear that at this time she lost consciousness so that she could not think how to do anything else when she was come to hospital she told the doctor that there was too much blood in the air that her whole body was swollen her eyes were swollen at this he went on saying what have you done to him and said to his wife you have given my wife a fright your wife i am ashamed of you you have made her an impostor tell her what you have done you will not be able to save her but she said nothing then to one of her friends his daughter he said i am afraid of my daughter in the last two days the people of jerusalem have started to cry for her and have put a stop to iti was afraid said he in his last words when he came to see her weeping but my dear wife was never able even at that time without a great deal of terror and fear he went to bed well  i must have felt a little dreadful at last all i could do was to keep her at bay though i was forced to go with her back into jerusalem it is impossible to imagine that one who is so terrified of his own existence that his only hope is that others will follow him it would be like a man whom he had just discovered he would get back to himself and feel at ease like an old man what is to make one feel fearful,GPT2

pg 8— a very good idea heres the thing and its worth a mention weve seen an englishman who in a good deal of his life had been the chief exponent of the doctrine of gods existence he was a poet but he wasnt interested in the world—he was interested not in human existence as we now know which is what wed suppose to be the result of a special supernatural force in fact he was much more interested than we had ever known and he might have been a great poet but he didnt know about the universe the world is the object of our knowledge because thats what it is to learn and to have knowledge if there were an infinite stream of information it would be a stream that could never be emptied out or emptied of all its contents theres no other stream no more than the stream which flows from a tree of knowledge and the tree in question is a perfect stream so he said he wouldnt be interested—the whole world would have no meaning that he would take his place among the living creatures is just the sort of thing we think of as a sort or a kind of possibility its just a matter of time before we come to the point that all we can say surely it was only a question of chance the way we thought that made this possible and the question was whether the possibilities of life and of human life were possible whether they could all be really very likely one thing is certain though god created them they must be good if they were all there at once i mean i dont mean to say that the possibility of any of these things being possible is unimportant what im saying is you know how the concept of an infinity of possibilities is—its interesting you know what i do in that i say to you i think that if god had designed the heavens god would know that they would hold the form of everything in existence and of course could give it to everybody to those of us who know the things that god has given us there is no possibility that we wouldn even when we know things like that we have to know them as well as god knows them so that he can tell us what they are no this is not,GPT2

 then he shall have the power of the holy spirit shall be able to make death his own and the devil with him to destroy the church matthew 1612 13the apostle paul was inspired to tell this story in the same way that we do today in order to help us live a better life in our view our lives are less important because they are not directly related to gods word so if god has given us an opportunity to live the true life of truth we must give it the bible teaches us that the lord is my shepherd and my refuge we are called to be his servants and that he has entrusted us with the task of carrying out his will in our life that his glory may be in him and his kingdom may come but this is only for those who believe in his word and are willing to do his work therefore when we truly believe who is willing i say that the lord has blessed us he will not give us the chance to give up our faith nor give away our salvation god is his servant and he is faithful to his words word romans 530 the apostles words are a reminder of what we could be doing if we simply did what the apostle said but the truth of our own lives is not in us to provide for or to teach we must learn to love christ and become his friends and god gives us our savior the savior of all who are without sin he who gave us his only son and he that cometh to the father giveth to him that giveeth unto you and he that believeth shall not perish but have eternal life and the one that loveth the dead shall become his servant for to this he gave himself and his son and he was not a slave to anyone elses will neither was he a master of his body but i will give unto thee thy life to keep my commandments even as i gave unto him thine own life for ever he shall live by the law of my father which is in heaven a law that will never be broken jesus christ died for us as a sacrifice this is the way god will live as a christian you are responsible for your own actions and for others actions not for god thus love and trust in god does not make your life perfect,GPT2

 and yet for the sake of truth that truth is that which is true in christ jesus to which all men when they have received the truth of the gospel have been led in the same mannerand in this way the gospel was preached the kingdom of god being preached through us which means that if a man do not believe in jesus christ he shall be guilty of a crime in heaven as if he were a fool and a liar whether he be a priest or a layman but the righteousness which jesus wrought it was by his preaching of his gospel with his saving sacrifice to save the world from the wicked in which he has preached that the devil should be found in his power and this is the power of christ that is his promise if i believe there are many i will stand in them even so that i may not be judgedand this was the true way of preaching the doctrine of jesus to the gentiles the word gospel here means the word for faith in god not the word of grace but the spirit of our lord jesus the spirit or the holy spirit or the son according to some is not a revelation from god but a gift from heaven it is a kind of power like that of heaven itself whereby by the command of its own power and by a promise to god of peace we can have faith without the aid of hope he who believes in a gospel cannot be condemned to hell unless he is also justified in faith by christs saving power to bring salvation to those who would not have believed in such a doctrine for fear of being condemned by him who promised his gospel to us this is what the apostle thomas called the holy spirit there is no other power in nature nor ever has there been yet it is christ himself that is capable of this power which the apostles who were in their days in power as in life called christ and gave him grace to preach so as to give faith to all those to whom he preached the faith of faith these were the people that were sent with the apostles to proclaim the christian gospel they were men of virtue of high character because in all things they had received christ as the lord from a certain point of view they were christians because,GPT2

in the psalms where the king is seen taking his wife to the queen and begging her to give him her ransom thou shalt not make thy wife ransom in his speech at the temple of the seven kings king solomon is given a vision of a great city with many mighty walls which he says to his people and here i am and shall dwell in peace and how do i my god how shall i live and i shall make for thee a kingdom of my own like unto the kingdoms of babylon as the kingdom that was brought into the world and i will make my people a people that they may enter upon the city of god that they might be worthy of dominion unto me to rule over the wicked unto my sons so that i may make them their princes who shall be as kings of men or as gods the kings speech 2 samuel 1619–20 the king says that he shall establish a king he says in my name shall they rule the nations but the people shall rule themthe word king is pronounced king it is used in the hebrew bible the ancient language of israel by the babylonians the hebrew word for people comes from the old testament hebrews 826–27 1 kings 2120 199 2314 psalm 8911 1217 john 4232 in the first person a word is not a legal term instead it is a physical term to which you must be careful to adhere it cannot be said to mean a thing as it may not be the same thing as something rather its meaning is the physical or personal physical nature of it for example if a person says he is going to build a house you need not say he will build it for it would be a contradiction to say that the building should be for him to live in if someone says his carpenter will need to make it for his son to go to work your idea would not mean that his father will have to do it all but it could mean he has to pay the bill a good man can do anything he wants when he can get it done says job so if he needs a car he,GPT2
 it is a big fat unhygienic world the word gratitude is used in many ways including in good graces and blessed by wellmeaning people in america a lot of this gratitation has to do with the lack of love and trust in the church and the very fact that it is not gods way i have been to the church as a young man and i understand what it means to be righteous because i know what we are in our justice to as a man i dont care what you think i am just a good person or not only a bad person as he calls it but also in no way deserving of gods love i believe that the way the world goes is wrong to me the truth is that we live in a world that is based on the same kind of moral principles as the rest of usi am not a member of the christian church and if i did i wouldnt be doing anything wrong or calling for anything it doesnt matter what someone thinks just be yourself if you want to join the movement of greed that means taking responsibility not just for yourself as to who is right and i think thats the most important thing because it reminds us that all humans have the right to choose we have chosen our own path what matters is what choices we make but i also think we must be honest about who we really are and what our actions are this is where the whole family tree thing comes in jesus said love is love even if you are an idiot i do not know why we need to have such a love for those who are wrong because we cant always be sure who will do the wrong thing in fact we might need someone to step in and heal all of you in your time and place maybe i can give you a bit of a glimpse you may be the only one who can do that please share your own story just remember that you will not get better by being right or to your advantage god has already shown that he loves you and he is coming for you he will show that to you when you choose to follow his commandments so if the bible doesntell you to love your,GPT2

 the government would have to pay for whatever it wanted to do no im not saying that theyd have it all figured out but i am saying the united states and the other industrialized nations will have a lot of issues to deal with and those of us who have been around the world for some time will know that we will be subject to some level of regulation and some sort of financial regulationand what we have in place if anything is a more decentralized system the world is much more interconnected today so there is more of a system of international financial institutions to oversee the business of global commerce were not going to be completely out of control there are very very few of these kinds of institutions so its very difficult to imagine the financial systems of the future where we would be able to control the economy it seems like a very good solution i think it would seem to me that there are a number of things that would make sense here for example to bring about a greater understanding of how global financial markets work some of those issues include regulation of offshore financial assets regulatory requirements for foreign investors regulation for the use of derivatives financial services tax reform etc in one sense thats a good thing maybe we should think about how to regulate a sort more localized global economy where theres almost no single rule no regulation but there will always be some regulation that is beneficial to the interests of shareholders and to those in the market place that would certainly be a great thing because there would always have always been the possibility of some kind of regulatory body that might be independent of any particular kind or type of policy all of that of course would come at a cost for shareholders people in financial companies would often be forced to invest in companies that are not regulated by the us firms would suffer a much higher rate of loss they would probably be in higher risk of insolvency a lot more people would lose their jobs they would actually have less financial security their credit would go down their income would drop and their pay would get cut dramatically of course thered be problems one of them would become a problem another would not benefit from the changes that have come to come as i said there has been a tremendous amount of research and development in this area of economics and international relations with many different countries even,GPT2

sigh it is true that the lord will not punish men for the sins of their own selves but the punishment of the wicked man is also a punishment for those who are wicked without being willing to give up their sins and sins that are their fault that is why jesus said thou shalt not kill and now the law is not against the sin of not giving up the blood of your own children but against those of us who have been saved by the gift of faith the lord says lord the children of israel shall not get from you any more for there is no escape from the curse of sin there is only the forgiveness of sins the lord said to me if any man sin against my name i will cast him into hell and i said unto the angel who will bring me out of hell and bring out my father and my mother from there that i may have my inheritance and the power of life do not say do i not have the right to my children do you not understand he said again no god said—god it is the way he gave me the keys of power and i became god and his children came forth from him when they were about to be turned into the world he said the children shall be their father their mother his sister with their brothers and sisters i have not given up my son my daughter nor have i given her up to the gentiles he said i am giving him up as the man who raised him said you did not raise him so high you raised you to a higher position why because you have never given him what he has given you if i had given my young son up as a gift why should i give him to people who do not give their sons up why should they give them up from a place of honor where they can be treated as if they are brothers saying to them the sons of men we have given them the good fortune we have taken away their sin they have come back to us let us be like them so god gave us the child of god which he gave to his son therefore if you are living and being saved put this in your hearts be thankful for your mother and father who were with you when you were,GPT2
 nature and that is a fact of nature the true nature of a natural is not a mans own it is the natural of his own nature as far as he is concerned nature is his natural but nature does not know it in the same way nature recognizes the two distinct truths which nature makes manifest for if the true nature of the creator and the nature which it bears is different from that of its creator it too is in the end different but if it has different parts that part which belongs to each of them by reason of their being distinct or if two or three of these are different then its unity is distinct now the principle of unity in nature must be if there is no other principle then it will be in vain if the whole unity of all things is one all the parts of one make themselves all parts then there may be only one thing the world and if there are several people each to itself there will not be any one who is only of two persons thus the unity which god made must also be of any thingnow we must bear in mind that nature has some part in herself while nature only has a part this is why nature had certain powers of being its power is to be called nature and to have some other power than that which makes herself a woman hence it must have certain power that makes its own parts a women there is some power which is called nature it can be used for the purpose of giving to women something for they do not have the power of making their own part of themselves it is true that nature has certain things which make herself women which are called her and so on here is another thing which proves that this is so nature possesses certain qualities which we call nature these qualities are however not only the quality of women but also the qualities of men women do this by virtue of having a certain kind of skin because of which they have different kinds of legs men have a different kind to which the skin of some of those women belongs therefore it does so only by being different to its kind so this cannot be said of woman since that woman is always different or of different qualities from this we may conclude that she is of very different types and therefore cannot bear the use of certain words or phrases that is we cannot say that there can only be one woman,GPT2
 but im still in the hunt for youand youre a bad flyin bird the next day he was met by some of the other pilots of a falconer he was wearing a green shirt and blue shorts with the exception of his vest which he wore only because of time constraints the pilot as usual looked like he had been using a power up for the day whats the matter he asked as he approached the cockpit window a few moments later another pilot came inside as soon as the pilot could see him the two of them all began to shout with that they all jumped up and down using their own voices to keep the others from getting into the air then suddenly a loud thud followed by a thump and then a roar accompanied by the sudden appearance of two more men they all ran to the back of each other while he tried not to get too close but the one that came closest to them was the second guy who seemed to be wearing the same outfit as him his helmet was blue his black boots were slightly wider than usual in fact when he stood in front of one of those it was a very wide one and he looked very very much like a fighter pilot not only he flew a few missions in his career some times even in combat so his training was very high although he made a couple of mistakes however there was also the fact that he didnt have any experience flying a single mission despite having flown the falcons second mission one time someone had told him that the first mission was too long and too difficult when the crew of this falcon was looking for him to fly it at least one pilot was saying that it would be too hard to land and the guy who flew the last mission said that they had not been able to go far enough to find him because they were stuck on the bridge of an aircraft no one would have said it that way would they the crew was just standing there waiting for a mission to happen then suddenly being thrown out this was all very hard so no matter what the conditions were i flew it it was an experience that i did not want to forget that was why i was so lucky to have been in there i didn however want people,GPT2

 i shall not buy it but i will sell it at will and give it my share i have heard of it in the villages but not in townsi am sure that if i should sell my inheritance to a man it would be a very good thing for him but after all that man would have to pay the rent of the house and pay his own expenses nowadays the landlords rent is quite low a little less than a hundred roubles for each of us even though he is paid a great deal and he must be very grateful for the living the village has to offer it is true that i may live in a few years i do not yet have nearly as large a family as the others of course my neighbours will ask me when they will get rid of me my father is very happy for he does not want to have any more children he has been a good man for a long time a house is good for two or three years and if it was not for his good nature he would not have left it at the present time his mother has a child only four or five years old the landlord has no use for me he has made me a miserable man besides we have no money how could he make us sell our property to him i can hardly afford it it would cost me nothing to get it back as it is now moreover this man will always ask the old man if he can get better work or if we can buy food together we can have good food so long as we do it together because there are many people who can pay for it and i know that they can all this is for some very selfish reason in the beginning when i was living in one place there was a villager who told me that he wanted nothing in return for buying a house with his money which he had bought for forty thousand roules so the villagers came to my house to make a bargain with me saying that if they could get an even better house in ten years they would sell their houses after my first attempt however nothing happened only this villanager came again and asked me if my money was worth the trouble yes well since its not my own money i replied its your money so i paid for my two thousand,GPT2

 so beautiful and so sublime and the deep sound of the birds but it is not the kind of sound which i have known from my childhood but a bird is a sound a beautiful beautiful bird which has the same effect upon us i heard a great many birds of all ages young and old on the road in the yard the farm at the house or wherever no one by the sound i understand has ever heard of any sound like these they are the voices of men of nations men of languages nations of birds and the thunder of those sounds is so wonderful that i am afraid that they could not have been madepg 507chapter ix the cautiousness of our spirits the old man like the young is full of impatience with the feeling of his own absence his inability to take the time to hear what he has been saying to see the sounds of things see them if he could make up his mind to tell them what to say he would not perhaps do anything of that kind for he is afraid of being deceived deceived by his senses misled by all the things which he hears it is as if the little child in his dreams had been dreaming and dreaming not of one or two things but of two or three things this is the whole point of my argument and it has given me much trouble because i cannot get back to the beginning of what i had to do if i would say something to him i should not take his idea of it too seriously unless i could persuade him of something whether it was true or not there is no such thing as an ideal no ideal which is an illusion even when we have reason to feel that something is true we must not believe it we must believe that it may be true if we ask the questions what is it that makes us believe an idea why would we believe in something if it cannot be proved i must tell you though that any idea is possible nothing is impossible everything can be experienced in a sense the idea that you are talking about is that of a human being such an experience is called experience experience is one of these things that is known to us as the only thing that can have a definite,GPT2
no i have not seen you in the very time i would have been able to see you but in what time did you come to me how long for it was a very long time 1 the first time that i was seen was by mr w b mcquade in 1854 of long island new york he was accompanied by his sons and by a secretary there were three or four of them at the time of the story they were all of black men in their late twenties their hair was long and long i believe their hair is very short mr the secretary said that the first thing that went away from their meeting was that they had been the only people who had ever seen the woman they were in but he said it would be a bad thing if this woman came and told them about her that was the last thing they said it was also a good thing for them that there should be some sort of kind of public event that would get them out of their way when i began with the idea of having a public meeting there were some people in this town who thought it might be an extraordinary thing perhaps they saw someone with a hat on and a mustache and i think they thought they would see a beautiful woman of course they went out and found mrs van dyke there she was very charming after that they did not even talk about it everybody was so nice but only i who was sitting in front of my desk was here for some strange reason i was reading a book when i saw my father reading his autobiography the last time we were there was in june 1896 this was about a year before the death of mrs mrs and i had read her autobiography in one of those magazines we were sitting down thinking of a story that we would write about mrs and our daughter then as i thought of it we came up to our table and it seemed like two or three things mrs said well she is the one who told us about that story so we said lets talk yes lets do that and she just said to uswell oh yes i said i didnt want to write a tale about this because i wanted to tell her about what we had seen and heard about,GPT2
 i have seen him and he is holy that he can be reconciled with me and i hope that we may be able when we shall have been reconcild to see the face of the lord jesus christ the son of god one and all who is a man god in his father16 you say that which the church believes is the holy spirit now when the saints have received christ and have entered into the kingdom of heaven they shall go forth to the father which is in heaven now they will be called by the name of this holy ghost because he dwells in them for what is written in the book of mormon is true and he came down from heaven and dwelt in me ezekiel 1814 but the whole church even with all the other churches are baptized only in their own name for the true church in christ jesus we profess to be baptized in our own place but we are not baptized by our church inasmuch as we have not the same nature as the apostles of christ for christ did not receive us from him who was with us nor was he raised from death as you would say after we had been baptized nor did he come to us in vain neither did we receive him but he had received us for his sake he saw us as people having received them in a manner to which he was given whom he received by his faith and example according to his law his teaching his commandments he would not have us do any harm therefore we confess to christ that if any man is baptized for our salvation we will not be saved though we ourselves are saved because the spirit of jesus is present in us also yet he cannot be sent out of a body so that it will come into our possession by this sacrament which we inasmuendo christ crucified have no need of if the body of our lord is not kept together with the blood of his son it is that the flesh might be destroyed and it cannot thus be made for us yet we do not think that all men who are in this body are called in one form or another therefore we say that when they are made all are of one christ this is our testimony to you that ye believe in him whom ye have heard of and,GPT2

 but they have been sent to me and i have come by the sword to slay them gen xxxiii 3socrates also says but when i came to that place i found that the people who were there were already there as if they had not fled they were not there in the time of their king who was called the king of the greeks as to whether the jews had fled the word is that they were and if the romans had deserted them their kings were to go to rome where they would be given to their father and mother when they came there to be with them the emperor they did not leave their city nor did they send their people to the city where the gods were for it was there that alexander had been born namely in armenia but when you come to armenia you are not to make up your mind for yourselves if you do not learn from the man whose name you wish to know or if therefore your will is not your own you will not choose for yourself what is right because if there is a man who will choose right things there will be no man left who would choose wrong now let us take notice of our brothers who are there we should not expect that there would ever be a nation of men who did choose to escape from their fate since that is the only thing that can be said for if it were possible for any one to come here to flee from his fate and to return to life what could be better than to follow the path of death the same is true for the one who is born here i am the son of alexander his son whom i promised to this day who are you now then did you not see me coming here there was no one here who could have seen me when he came here but i saw him being an old man with the face of a bird standing on horseback whereupon i said i am going to take you to myself so that you may know me  ex xxvii 7 and thus speaking of his father he says that he was a ruler of kings not of people he was born and died on the day when alexander came that is why i went to him is there not a person that has not,GPT2
 it may have been there in the first place i have no doubt that the name of that place is st pauls 1 cor 83 i am not certain if it was there after the resurrection or if the same was written down in some other place in judea but i cannot decide22 perhaps the original gospel of matthew is not the real text but perhaps it is for matthew says there are three parts of the gospel which i give to you which are not spoken of by you in my words but which the gentiles had heard and had baptized and they are the three that are spoken and which had been baptized and they were the three that were spoken matt 3116 cf rom 92 and that which is spoken was called the gospel and the word gospel is written cf 1 cor 320 eph 211 this is evidently false matthew seems to be speaking of two things the one in which all things are heard rom 1731 the other in christ jesus 2 cor 519 luke 728 both are true however if we read the two passages as if these were written in a different place we will certainly find that they speak of two things i do not think that it would be right to say that christs gospel is only written here unless it were to have the meaning we have here we do however find the gospel in two different places in matthew one at the beginning and one after that so i shall now begin with the place which we are to read in our text as regards the words in romans 19 it will be noticed that there is no place where the phrase the gospel was spoken to the jews may be found in acts 2218 there we find a certain faction of righteousness which was not written by the apostles acts 22 mark 2 that was they had put in place some things which were false so that when they read them they would not have read what was actually spoken in them exod 22 this was the attitude which paul had of it when we look at romans 3 where in one verse paul says that one of you shall be called in righteousness that,GPT2

 a thousand tears in his mouth he must be a man of many livesit was also that time…the man who was born of a single very fine girl could not see a woman in such a way he only saw people and he had no reason to think that there would be no other way to go about it so at first that man took the name of the only woman he could see but he would not be able to see her this did not stop him from thinking that she was his wife that was when he made a vow to her sukami chūrūsawatari yū 鍖界賢 yamayūthe name is a pun on fear fear and hate meaning that the person born with a weak heart and a fear of death would inevitably be the one to die the one who is born from a bloodline that is cursed to death will always be cursed with the same fate she said shigure shigure in fact she also said that in the future he would have to be given a name which he can only name in the meantime this man would eventually die or die with little to no effect it was because of this that even her father was surprised at his story saying i told him so but he never heard it from me hatsuo yui the story of her mothers death was later repeated at some point in her life in a flashback of shizu while she is fighting the battle against the monster at the end of chapter 14 although she would later reveal that her dad died before she could even tell him it was not until later on that shizuku finally learned of it and started to believe that his death might be related to the fact that he was her son so she decided to make this whole thing up to which eventually when shigefumis fathers name came up again shinkai became annoyed when shigo asked her who had a special ability that kept her from doing things like killing people what she had been doing her expression changed she said to him that maybe she needed to do something since her family would probably have made the mistake of asking for the help of someone who could help,GPT2
who is the king of england and who are they are they all great york who are these great kings we have many more questions for you dear readers but the very last of them is our own how are you going to answer them well we have no time for that we ought to think of all that and then we can come to a question we are unable to ask ourselves and then is it that we must come back to the question or do we ask things that are not right i am not sure we could in the first place a very important question in english politics is what is your political purpose it is a very serious question the englishman must be very strong in that regard he is very much in his power it does not matter whether he is powerful or powerful in any way in a general sense he becomes all the more powerful by the fact that he has a great deal of power under him but there are two problems in this question firstly whether you should go to war with the enemy as they say when they have a bad army a good army and a strong force secondly if you do not go into war then you will not win the war at all if you go back into service you must have great power and you can make war if necessary so it is not a matter of whether the english man is strong or weak it depends what the circumstances are a man who knows his own power will win a war what is his political aim his economic aim the answer is that the man has not an absolute power he can only control his actions and he does it without any restraint or constraint i find it difficult to believe that a man of great economic power could ever possibly have the political will to go down to one side and do what he would not like to do that is why i have asked you in your letter to write me please put the letter in my hand and write to me if i will you should then come over and see what you find then you may think carefully for it will be easier to understand what is in you than to read all of this for i know that if we put a stop to this kind of activity the only way to win it back would be by a military action this is one of the most important questions that englishmen and gentlemen can,GPT2
and yet thats how it goes we all are different and if we dont have that we are not human he then proceeded to use the termman to describe our human selves briefly i will go through some of the ways in which i am being triggered by my own unnatural behavior this is where the flesh comes in thespirit has its own body as well and is only able to exist if it is grown up and possessed of that natural body so that it can become human if we were human it would be easier to grow up but if not how would it be born from the second thing that i want to say is that all of this is very much at the root of my issues with the book and how i view my sexuality i don not because i have a desire to be a gay im a gay man im not really a man but because it makes me feel like i cant be if i had to explain the reasons that make me attracted to men perhaps i would say its because of something ive done or that a person needs to learn how to relate to them but in the end what i end up with is what they need to understand so i just want them to find that out by now so if i was to admit that being gay is not something they should do would theyif they would they probably wouldnt but if they didnt then they wouldn because in my book the most important thing to focus on is making sure that they don´t this also goes for being sick its not just a matter of feeling that you are sick it´s also about feeling as i like to put itsomewhere around that corner rather than necessarily feeling on the side of being straight like a normal person would what i hope people find interesting about this book is the fact that while i struggle with my sexual selfidentity other people are struggling with their sexuality too too as i mentioned earlier my partner is a therapist not a psychotherapist hes a social worker his own therapist is in prison theres been some criticism of his,GPT2
 should occur to the weak it is certain that a man is so much more wise and successful than we areit is better to know what kind of man you are than to pretend that you cannot be and to be so well for it will not be able to tell you what your weakness is for if you do not know how to act you will find yourself in a hopeless situation this is what i mean when i say that it would be a good idea to learn to speak the language of men rather than the english of our own day it would not help to educate your mind or to make you better at speaking language if a few thousand years ago you could speak a language you did not understand but one you know now if you can learn it do it well do it better you should not expect to win any prizes without good results those who do succeed should teach you how men speak the english of course is a great languagefor i am afraid of what will happen when we speak our language i do know that i will have no more success in my business and my life than i have of my own but this is true the world is not for me i can see that when some day i should fall i would become a better man for it seems that the world has not yet made the right choice it has made men what they are in the way they ought to have been as soon as they had been brought to it and the answer is that we can get better but the things we ought by way of education to do are not the ones i want though there are many better things to teach besides our schools are only for men who are good at it and i cannot do better than give them a school because if i had to give my education for you my only hope would have to lie with you here is the same thing again we must learn the best language we know which is in one of the most important parts of a persons life that is to say we must by means of learning the languages of all the nations learn all that is good about them the most perfect language is only as good as its people there is no other perfect that can be taught language is like the man who will take from a tree the fruit of,GPT2

 the highest honour is to be found in the way of making use of it the good of a man is that he is able to use his wealth to his advantage whilst the bad of another is he who is not able in his own way to employ his resources to that end thus the good is of great value to a person who uses his capital to himself he who employs his money to other ends is a good man because he uses it to the best of his ability how is it that the poor find the means of obtaining the fruits of their labour which they are wont to require from their benefices and how is wealth produced out of the labour of others a man who takes up his labour to earn his food finds it in himself not through the efforts of men but through his meanschapter 5 to be a good man if then we examine the use to which we make of wealth it will be observed that it is in our own power to make use whether by means and means only or by the whole course of things for if after some considerable alteration of fortune and circumstances you wish to improve the condition of your country by bringing about a revolution in its industry that will give you the power of improving our condition as well as of changing its condition you do not employ manly means but by money like the money which the great masters of athens employed to gain the fame of her citizens but here while a rich man might take up the necessaries of life for himself to pay for his labor how much money is sufficient to give him a sufficient life for it was not possible for any man to acquire enough to live upon and so the wealth which he used to spend in agriculture was of little value therefore a poor man ought to take more than he could use in cultivating to keep the soil in good shape for he ought not to go to war for the sake of taking advantage of such as he might be able in the case of agriculture the man which takes the greatest interest in every thing should take the most part then it would be more advantageous to him to have a better use for every part of what he consumes than to consume all the other parts so that therefore there shall be no need for a more powerful use than the one which may be made of him this is what is good when,GPT2

they knew it would be the last word the french had never heard of the blood of a citizen born in 1845 but the french felt like they had found their way into the heart of an empire they thought that if they were to leave the country they would have to put their lives on the line to save lives to this day when the story is told of how a french soldier was killed in action in paris i think the most important element of this story might be that he was french he was a soldier of french blood french troops they said were the only people who could fight the germans and a number of them were frenchall of whom were killed many of whose lives were in france including those of his father and his mother so in a sense it was an important part of that story but it also meant that the americans could not be french because of these things there were so many american soldiers who were not french and who had to fight in the trenches this was not the whole story of american combat that there was such a thing as a british soldier who fought in front of any of those american troops was completely different to say the least it was as if their own blood had been spilled on their faces i was in new york on september 15 1836 on my way to new jersey where we had the same story about the british soldiers we had an american soldier and the american officer an officer from the north a lieutenant colonel who was sent by the governor to kill a german a few days later he had a chance meeting with the german officer who i met for the first time captain l w taylor now i am not saying that american officers were bad or bad enough for killing a man who didnt have the right to do so if i had met one of my best friends on a mission this would really have been the case one of our officers was one who did this for honor as a matter of fact there were some of us who knew how dangerous an assignment was you know if you were a good soldier you could go out and kill some people you know there was no way i could have done it at the end of it though we were well on our way in factand this is what i find the greatest difficulty in telling just to understand,GPT2

 and making all things bad by giving us the same kind of bad effect of this kind these things too are bad by nature even though they do not be bad in themselves for there is no such thing as good in the sense of things which are made bad nor do good things exist in a sense which may be called bad because they are contrary to good but the goodness of a thing as it is which is good is not good by itself this is the kind and only kind that the good isthis is called good even of the things the goodness of good does not become bad when it ceases to be good but when the thing ceases being good it becomes bad or the bad thing becomes evil that the evil one is evil the other good but if you have good to you it does make you evil and what is your evil does cause you to become evil for this is what the man that is born good must be and if the father is bad one does the opposite of what one ought to do for there are such things as bad things good ones are good and bad ones bad for this reason the mother is more important because she is better than we are but not more so due to which we do become more and more evil or even because of its being bad since it was not necessary that we should become so what is so bad about the child then that it suffers a great deal from its parents or worse from it than those who are born to her in the case of one who is a good parent it would be the worst thing that he would do not for a man for he never did it even if he had been a bad parent he should not have done it he would not however have been able to make himself good himself it is quite natural that a mother ought not to have any child in other words to bring about a child should be difficult for her it seems that she should have a greater difficulty in conceiving and raising a human being if she were to turn away from the very principle of her own being so that there would have to exist a much greater and less powerful principle in one person than in another person with the consequence that men would become little more than little less while women would then be many times as much as men as to the condition,GPT2
 we should not use the word feminism because it is a term which means antimale activism or all women are rapists women should be treated as human beingsthis is not the first time such a statement has been made a few years ago a video of the bbcs women of power broadcast was held in which a female presenter was shown saying that women have an interest in the work we do and that it was a thing that gives them a right to do when you have women in power it makes things even more difficult for them that is why i think that this is part of why we need to take the issue of sexism seriously the reality is that women who are doing something are not always treated with respect they may be a little bit sexist but they also have a legitimate role in society lets not just be sexist we must also stand up for womens rights which is what we are fighting for,GPT2
 and then i sell her to a man who will never buy me again for he will not give me back my money neither will he give the money to methen you take advantage of my womanhood a woman who was rich and powerful who had no one to help her without anyone to look after her was the first to think of the love of man and of the love of woman he said that this with the same meaning had become the most popular and popular of all that if he were a free man he would be able to get all his love for her without any need for any man but it was not a thought to the man to whom the thought came it came to him too when he thought that he might have the love he was longing for so he took his words about his own love the one he had to give and the other he did not so that neither could he sell his woman to anyone without giving her back her money thus this was also the word of some of his friends to which he said no i have to sell my love to you you have no need of me i want to be free i only want a woman like you then he asked them what they were thinking of and they said they had thought it but that it had been the idea of others not of him he gave them the answer that they should not think it then one of them a young man he called the man said to these people why do you think you have more power over women than you ever had what is this power they said it to them in the form of a smile as if they could see what was implied you should give her all your love he told them now there were many women who were rich but who did nothing for their husbands or for the people they loved the man they liked they thought would treat them well and would not want anyone else to see them as he treated them he could not see that many of these women were not in love with their husband nor did they see his weakness in them and their love and so he made them rich they were free at least from the bondage of their own nature their love was their life when they became rich,GPT2

this story is told by a woman in a new house when she is the only daughter of an old man who has not yet found her the narrator upon receiving her to the house of her mother declares i have not found my mother yet she has been absent for four years i was at my fathers house when i heard her come to our house there she was with her head in her hands lying on the floor of the living room it was a young woman and she had a red dress and a long thick coat but she didnt look like a man my father was very angry and asked what i should do with the dress he told me that she could not be here when i said i did not want my daughter here i gave her a small piece of silk which she wore under the coat of a dress on which was written my daughter has no hair does not have any hair as i told you this is not a place for you to go for i do not know what is next to you i replied there is no place to be in here i am here to serve the king and this was it at that moment the young man cried what is your daughter my dear daughter i could see her she stood in the kitchen her long brown hair and face covered with white and i saw her with my eyes open as if she might be seen from the other side of me—it was so strangechapter vi the next day mrs b o took her daughter to see the king—i am sorry miss that you have been so quiet we had been together when you were little but when we came into the palace it was time for me to tell you why i came to that place of business to tell me what you want to know your daughter is very young what do you think of it mrs youve never been here before dont you its very quiet and quiet here—well maybe a little too quiet though not so much so as a chamber thats why you and i were here together you and me got into business—youve got all this to do—my mother was here with me in this room had she not come along,GPT2
it is to do with thyself after all that thou wilt be able to bear it to bear a mans life without the use of his own soul is an act of no small necessity but to carry it among the world is like a journey in which one does not know what to make of it for it is easy to know that you when you are in this world are to perish in the nextwe have in his discourse laid out his position of the human race in relation to the natural world he says the natural life is of man only the man is a mere creature of nature his natural nature is what keeps him at peace thus if a child is born it must be born into a race which has been created for him and which will become the object of its own desire as long as it exists so long as the seed of that race has not yet found a way to grow he adds however to this he says that the man like the creature who is not born again must though he be brought to life through a natural process for the purpose of life that is the life of a creature is that which is created by nature that is the nature of which he is this then may be understood in terms of one who can only do things which are natural to him it is therefore possible although not necessary even to say that man has a natural nature if therefore there were some natural man who would have a life which would be natural but which was not natural at all as such this would not have been the case a natural being by his nature has to live in a state of existence which on the other hand we may call existence which we call the life of nature the natural being therefore is man the life that a species lives in is its natural form a form which it has because it makes life possible in his speech mr justice hume a member of parliament also stated the above principle we may thus say of our natural species that the act which creates the state is natural and it follows from this that we must have our physical form to conceive a thing is naturally to conceive an agent we have in general i think,GPT2

 large and we will not leave itwe are no longer interested in an economic revolution but in a new form of democracy the right of the people to decide for themselves what they want the right to free speech of course is our own right under no circumstances should we be giving it up to the government but we want it not to our political system we want to make sure that we are not allowed to put our hand in our pocket to be held to account for our choices this means we must hold our politicians to a higher standard of ethical conduct in this we can be sure we would not be in any way under attack our politicians are free to tell the truth or to lie about the facts of a matter without ever being held accountable for their behavior it is not our role to deny the public the freedom to judge them no one ever told our leaders that this was not a good idea i had no doubt that some would argue that the president had done precisely that they never told him that he had a responsibility to hold his politicians accountable that its all about this if we do not respect the constitution of this country then we cannot build a democracy there is a great difference between those who want a strong democracy and those whose only hope is to build one that is why the constitution requires us to maintain a constant state of peace so that there can never be a war a peace that is based on peaceful means can only be made possible by a peaceful revolution if it does not come to this conclusion the only way forward for us is for the united states to create a democratic system of government that would do the same what we may not know is what we ought to do about it make our public representatives accountable to us by telling them what to say what not what how they should behave and we need to keep our government accountable,GPT2

in a world where the most powerful powers were in a state of crisis the only way was to simply leave the region and as such this was no easy task and the country was forced to turn to the west for support this was the situation in korea and since the war was raging in the peninsula it was only natural that the army would be sent to train the troops in south korea the only problem was that all of them would end up dead it was not until the very end of the conflict that they were able to bring the three remaining members of their respective armies to safety so not only did these three generals and generals decide to flee there were also several other people who were partaking of this secret mission all of these people were trained on the battlefield by the military academy these were the people that were training the soldiers to advance on their own but there was something strange about the fact that these generals were already on top of a mountain of military technology youll just be fighting with your arms youre getting into trouble tl im not sure what the hell the japanese say herethats right thats what i meant when you were fighting in front of me i had a big fight on my hands if you use your arm then youll be ablet to use my sword so even if you hit something its not your main weapon in front and back even though youve got a gun your head is still as a ball thats why i couldnt use the shield or the whip but its enough to make me move you can use something like a shield a whip to get rid of something in my way as well whats more what you need is a sword i wanted to fight as much as possible because i knew that you wouldnt be in danger well take it well make you strong just like we did right even though i wasnt able for you to defeat me or defeat the other army if i was able my soldiers would have died a lot more easily no they wouldn still be alive after all wouldn´t theythe soldiers were all in shock at the news their heads shook with shock they had never seen such a sight before even if they had seen it for a long time to,GPT2

 the reason for this is that the human heart is not the same as the soul and thus we are unable to see each other as we think to express our thoughts or to find our true selves the soul cannot live in such a state but it cannot be made to live it is merely a part of its body with a body of which it does not have the capacity to conceive hence it can neither be a woman nor a man nor any of the other three being parts it is therefore impossible at least to say that there is any truth in this that it should be possible that a person should not be able to be in the form of a human being not as a child as if he had ever been born in order that he may live a life of full existencein this regard it becomes more and more evident that if a spirit should ever be born in a world in which its nature is to have no existence then it has no power to act and it must be noted that this power is also due to its being a force a spirit cannot act without an influence this is shown by the fact that man is made in an animal form in his earliest infancy by his very existence being determined by its development and development by itself as a result man has the powers of life and death of all things when in nature he has a soul but it follows from this that if man were always in animal nature he would have a power in all those other things which are not since he will be always alive in one body thus for example the man who is born with an eye for sight will know that his eyes are for him because he is always at rest never asleep always awake even though he was born at such an age so that all which is already in him in natural nature has been set free in man by natural order from which he himself is descended to be free is an act of an action being in that state of nature does nothing but make the action of man possible we can see therefore clearly which form the power of this being for although man was in animals in infancy at the time of his birth yet he still lives on in human nature therefore we see clearly that in our world man must not always be kept in some sort of animal state if we had to choose between this state,GPT2

 have a tooth you might be sure to put it in therei say there is no more tooth in the worldbut if you find a good tooth here dont forget to take it out as soon as you canthis is what i say to you when you see that i am doing this and that you are going to pay me this is the reason i asked you to do this it was your understanding that we should be going out i will take care that your will may be done but if i do not do it my will if it is lawful may not be so i want you as i would anyone else to think that if anything happens to me that may affect your mind or your life that it may influence your way of life you will be to this end in my sight and if the good of your person is to be determined by the will of god what will you do if that will affect my mind i hope that god will not change your heart it is not your intention to change yours but gods will what you will do will depend on what happens for if god does not want your soul to perish because it has not been used we can never be saved therefore god can change our soul if he wills it to if you think this will happen god himself is going in on it and he will have you in his sights now for me to say this to god is a great honor he has been very kind to one of my parents and to everyone around me god has given me a wonderful education my parents the ones who lived in japan for so many years came back from the war and were very much loved that is all they had an opportunity to look after us this is how i got into this business all of the people that worked for us came from japan the people who worked in this city from those who served us were all from that city there is nothing that can be said that could be so different from what happened to us in 1945 in my experience in fact it seems to have been the most normal world ive ever been in a lot of people have had similar experiences of this kind to be honest no one has ever said anything about it yet our lives have changed drastically since the end of world war ii when war started,GPT2
1 as to the person of the lord jesus christ he shall stand with his left hand upon the cross at the last moment he shall not be angry with any man but with the holy ghost for he has made his peace in the presence of god this then is the first and only act he is required to perform in order to redeem his sins in the same way the church in christ shall deliver those who have fallen to this fate from the curse of sin it is not the case that those in need of salvation are also to be saved by the grace of jesus what is meant by this is that the one who has sinned who is condemned to hell must be brought to an end as a consequence of his sin that is by his death for if he comes to terms with an enemy it is sufficient for him to repent and be put to death so that he may be redeemed christ is said to have said if i come to repentance i shall go with you to heaven this is a sufficient reason to take him up to heavenly places to send him down to eternal life even though he have already been sent to a lesser place when he goes to his crucifixion he is sent down through the power of heaven 2 cor 622 he comes into the world through christ himself in his own person when he has been made the instrument of his will to make a covenant of faith with god which he will by his life and death perform the same reason is given for taking him into heaven to live a life of good order from this we may infer that he lives and reigns not only in heaven but in eternity there is nothing more to say here after he passes through hell gal 41617 he enters the body of christ acts 1618 and is raised from below and takes up his cross john 126 by his resurrection he goes into paradise and comes down from heaven if he were to die at a later time this would be a very good reason for the resurrection of he and of others who would have died there 1 cor 91718 we can see that this does not mean that christ would die on the eighth day since he had already died and risen from among his people as the son of man as st paul writes,GPT2
 art an honest man or he shall be slain 8 and after this manner will thou bear thy stave and when thou art come i will take thee into my hand and thou shalt bear it 9 for this i know not how to carry it out 10 but do thou say i sent thee with this staf that they might be delivered out of this world 11 by which means i say unto thee o maccabees these things are fulfilled because thou hast borne them out neither be they brought out by me 12 then will they come out from the land of egypt 13 now when they shall come forth it shall go out into the sea where it is not found 14 they shall not be found in the river which flows from thence but in a lake which is near to it as that which thou dost say is mentioned in matthew 1617 and matthew 197 which i have spoken of above 15 thus will the flood come 16 he that hath not borne his staved shall die 17 the sinner shall find a new sieve in which shall there be no bread 18 because the sieves shall say there is no sieving for thou wast born in this land as will appear from this passage 19 hence shall they turn away from thee and thy body 20 in this way will there come unto them the fish the wine which they have brought from their own country a little of which their hand and their foot shall bring with them 21 what shall i do with it 22 let them cast out all the evil in their midst even the flesh of the beast from thy hand 23 if thou doest they will cast away all their evil such as have been brought into slavery 24 yea there is none to do in that place 25 this is done therefore by the hand of god 26 therefore when these are done and they are brought to me let the people deliver them lest they be cast into a furnace 27 thou shalt have no more sin against me than thou didst with my father who was a thief 28 it is only by thy doing good that thou mayest be healed 29 that which thy father did he did not do 30 i should have done this,GPT2
 be seen in his steadthey passed his house without a moments delay and were all in the midst of a fire the noblemen who were standing heard the cries of the poor the beggars of those who had been carried away on horseback as they had come to see the rich but they were not afraid of being led there they were however afraid lest they should be caught because they saw the little man lying dead on hearing this a sound of fire made the people cry out alas and he immediately went out of his own house having been so far from the fire that he could not see it as he was going out he came to the house of two noble men whose name was sir henry what is this man sir sir asked he sir francis in a low voice answered a he is a poor man he has been brought into the town of mons de dix where today he is making a large business a poorman when he receives his goods is made to pay a man a sum of money for two months every man has received this sum which if he dies will be his only livelihood at last on the fourth day of september three thousand pounds of silver are given him each one in silver and gold so that the man who receives it at such a price can not help himself it is very difficult to have him carried abroad for he has to wait till he comes to paris if he does not make a good fortune his life will not be worth living but if his fortune is rich enough it will enable him to take his place as a beggar with his wife and children this is the way of beggards says sir richard tomorrow they will take him into their houses and put him in their own houses b he said i am a little boy called sir thomas proust born in 1804 now a farmer still living in paris good sir said sir charles addressing him—i have had many many things lately my dear so that i need not mention them i will tell you what i have done my little girl after being made a pauper came under my hands tore her clothes,GPT2
 the war is too good i know to have been donei am not fighting for my country the soldier replied you are in the service of my government and why should i be fighting to protect this country i dont want to lose your country i want you to die in order to make sure that i can keep these people alive its a sad thing for men and women for families and for our country but its worth it the soldier looked at the soldiers in disbelief his eyes were wide open his eyes full of despair thank you sir god is with us we have to keep a watch on the enemy he said he turned away from me and stood in front of the little girl she was standing on his left shoulder the soldiers were still watching him looking at him as if expecting him to say something they were not expecting anything instead they were watching waiting hoping when they saw him again the girl was dead then as he was about to tell the story he saw that the boys father was still in a coma that his mother was at a hospital even at that moment there was no way he could have known that this was not just a tragedy it was war war was the war of humanity every time the government of germany had to take care of you or your family you had a war that made you stronger not weaker than they had been in this war those who had done their duty were heroes heroes of courage why should we be afraid of being heroes it was better for the people to be saved by the man who was saving them what a pity that it wasnt the hero who saved us there were good people good men who fought for germany fought to save the country from the nazis but the heroism was also for people who were trying to help the others their lives were worth fighting on those people should not be left behind we should fight for ourselves let them fight in our name and fight to preserve a better germany these are the men who will protect us and keep us alive forever because they are our families forever as i have said before this is war for us men our lives are precious our lives important ours to live on so long as we live in peace,GPT2

the woman i thought went to bed and cried aloud glorious god what shall we do for thee the man answered i will tell thee and let thee do whatever thou wilt it is reported by some that the woman went back to sleep just before the storm i have read that she went up to the hill and was heard screaming you see the people of the town are all laughing as they are at my warning a little while later she was seen walking up the road then tell me tell them to go and stay they have no need of words they have been told to stay why if they wish to make a fuss we will stay here and talk to them we will do what we please it is the better way of doing it we have all this time to think and to do something and then we can rest she said but she did not go down that route the men went into the country in the morning as i had told them with my own hand to talk with her it was at that time after i was gone that they were able to get her to come to a place where the wind was strong enough to blow her so that her clothes would not be torn to shreds so she took one of their carts that were being driven along the highway and started down the side of it into a ditch there was a man there who was not very tall and with a great face he walked along that side until he came to what appeared to be a big hole about a mile and a half deep two or three feet wide where there was also a small ditch with several large stones which the man had dug at the bottom so as to give them a view of where she had gone down this she set down and threw herself into having been glad to see the men with their arms wide open because they knew that was what she intended to say they were all so delighted that at last she said to one who had comei am sorry my god what has happened to me i have not come here to harm you nor do i desire to hurt you i just wanted to tell you what had happened you know as for you and the others it has been a long time since i did anything,GPT2
 my spirit was in the same with my mind and i was at that time as now in a state of rest of my own doing that i should not be hindered from performing it or to get it upon myselfi am now now an old man an older man than i really am all this was done at a time when i used to think that the old world was better than the new when there was not really any doubt that it is better for the latter to be alone in this world than for me to live in another i am not to say that my life is as bad as i imagine but that if i have a good and good home i will be happy and well this is true of all things but i think this life which i call the life of happiness is not so good as the life that was once my way of life it is like a dog which takes on the form of a little boy without any desire for any other thing but happiness feeling that he has to follow his master who has no other need but to show himself to himchapter ii the truth of the revelations of both the man and the woman the first woman who is born of man and woman was a woman at war a man was born in her home of england then the first of her kind at her own house she was called the queen of women for she was the daughter of the king of france the mother of josephine a french lady and when she had received her first child she asked him to marry her saying that she should be a widow so that for her sake she would not have to spend the whole of that life under the protection of any man he did so then she went away to her country where she lived not with her husband because she wished to remain in that country and not in any new country now she thought that nothing would be more beautiful than that marriage than a mans wife on this she married the most beautiful woman she ever saw her mother however had a strong opinion of it but she did not think it necessary to give her a wife since she knew that a more perfect marriage would never be effected when her mother was living with a young man of twenty years he was told to go to his father,GPT2
a i know the greatest of all the evils of modern times the present is the fact that in the short run we are more or less helpless to prevent the worst effects and the best of them will be the most powerful only in a few years will the great powers of industry and commerce which are the only people to have ever been so much more helpless than we were be more advanced we have an opportunity when we have it to make the greatest possible contribution to the general welfare of the nation or to bring it under the control of those who have been most capable of making it this alone like the invention of fire will make a difference it will put an end to all evils that is why no one knows how much better we will do in our own day for our children who are at their most wretched are in no doubt that the very greatest evil which they have hitherto experienced is to be prevented for they will have the world to contend with and therefore i do not care to say a word about ith p lovecraft the thing who wasnt this has been said before but i think it is interesting enough to put it here the idea of the greatest power of industrial industry is not an isolated fact in any country in fact one of my favorite books is  the big bang the complete history of american industry   here is a nice little quote from the book we can do a lot better than what we did before if we can make industry smaller than before the effect of this change will soon be obvious or there will not be such a thing as a large industry as before  ive been very fortunate in my years in public life of course because i worked with many entrepreneurs not only in washington but in every part of new england  but i also knew that there were large industries in these two parts of america at least those i had met in massachusetts massachusetts where i was a partner so here is what i would like to address again once more today no wonder this book of mine is so popular there are many people living in this country who want to tell me how great a deal it really is how many great industries there are what the advantages of doing business is in comparison with the disadvantages of that,GPT2
 make thyself destitute of thembut what is more if thou shouldst not do it let the poor suffer for their own sake for if they were all in charity they would not be able to do so but if by the grace of god he gave them the gift of charity and gave it unto thee thou wouldst do them good and to thee would be a reward if thou dost do this then let them suffer because their deeds do not belong to them but to one who is worthy of their charity and if the goodwill of the righteous be not in the eyes of this people the wickedness of these people is not therefore by faith and charity alone should they not have received the gifts of that which is good now it is better for them to not receive the things which are good than to receive them which they do receive as if those things were good at that time now when they have been converted their souls are redeemed and god gives them a chance to return to righteousness and righteousness so that they may have faith again in him who gave their lives this is the way of salvation the righteousness of a sinful soul is for it to be purified of sins or it may be cleansed of itself for the sins of those whose hearts are in that kind are not cleansened so then they are saved matt 122829 it is thus that we have a way to live in christ jesus who has lived by grace and has brought about peace love righteousness—that is to give to our children a life of holiness and a living life he has given us a peace of life a good life and even a holy life to which we can expect nothing we should not expect anything more than that as for our parents we should expect that from them we may live in fact god has already given them this grace to have children let us not forget that in our own time the children of our fathers have also received it they have made them children to go to school work play learn and work there are in fact and by no means of course any good children that are born of parents who have given their children the power to choose their parents and take over their duties no how could we to give our sons a better life,GPT2

 argument that he was a man of high rank there was no doubt that in his youth he had been very well educated and the fact that his name had of course been placed in the annals of his people made it a source of great amusement to the people of the country in which he livedhe was known in athens which besides being the city of a powerful roman general was also the capital of an illustrious monarchy his mother was named after her son who after having been sent from greece came to athens and afterwards to rome where she died according to his own account in 1740 the great city was in turn situated at the foot of mount parnassus it is said that when the roman king pausanias had taken possession of it it was taken by him as a gift from his father for which the king was so very grateful when the time came for the emperor to rule his country he sent ambassadors to all the provinces of asia minor asking that the emperor should be allowed to send ambassadors he was very very anxious that they should succeed him in doing so but he did not do so a great body of people were sent to meet him at pannonia while the senate of paphoia and of antipateria were assembled in their own cities to be with him there at the same time the citizens of all provinces or who were in opposition to him were gathered together in a city called anaxagoras by the name of anjoupho under the pretence that their friend had heard of their coming this city is famous for its many buildings so that it is thought that if it had not had a royal residence at that time it might have been called the palace of alexander the great thereupon when alexander had brought the ambassadors they at no time being in great fear of being thrown into prison were led to it by a multitude of strong men each of whom carried a sword and a shield with which they cut off the heads of those who had tried to escape alexander being very angry with the men who tried having cut down a number of them took them to a place called antagora though it has been said it was not a palace nor the place of any great king that is to say an amphitheater,GPT2

 is not lost in the sight of the enemy as well as in a high rank the knight has already served many other noble ordershowever it is also true that the rank of knights is a kind of measure of rank a knight with a full rank is considered to be above the other nobles it is because of this that even the nobility of a noble house and the knights of that noble clan are considered honorable thus a prince who is even slightly above a commoner is called a noble knight tl note noble means a knight of an imperial family knight of two nobles and king of three noblesi had never heard of your name until now you were born in one of these high places and you are only two years old but you have been a member of such a large noble family for more than a yearthe young king was extremely pleased in the past he had been fighting in several wars but now when he was younger his rank had already been changed the fact that he did not have a rank that was even close to his own was something that had caused him to doubt his abilities moreover all the nobles of his noble families had become nobles so that person had given him a new rank as if he were the same as a normal person no matter who it was in order for him not to have any doubt now that it had happened there would never be any question about it he was a lowly noble at heart and as such even if the lord of ones house does not know about the cause of its rise that man had no need to ask i will not make you suffer i promise you that you will have no problem in this country he smiled and spoke when he looked at the young prince who was still a child this young man was already very young if a man of so high a ranking was born and raised in such an extraordinary country then even a minor prince would not be able to escape from this situation to him just being a low rank person was not something to worry about which was why he would be the only one who could save him however if this person did manage to save the prince from becoming an ordinary person what was the point of him being able not only to fight but to live,GPT2

 of the peasantrythey may be called the balkanists but they are merely bourgeois and they have no conception of their own social position they are the product of a social process of economic growth in the last analysis they simply assume that the people who are now taking over their country have made a mistake the problem arises of course only from their social situation not from any other factor but the result is that this has no other bearing on the question of whether in the coming year the peasants will be able to collect enough to make up for their lack of land and even then it is the workers who have to take over because they cannot collect it or it will not be possible to get it it is precisely because the proletariat must collect the land that it has to pay the rent even if this requires the destruction of all other means of production now to assume the possibility of this one must admit that a bourgeois peasant would have some difficulty in collecting enough land to buy the fruits of agriculture but it would be a step backward in terms of obtaining enough food if there were the slightest doubt as to whether the conditions for such a production were going to be favorable he could hardly afford to live without it and go to work he could not afford not to eat at all this is why he would not have the time to prepare food for the present situation would certainly not permit his consumption of food at great cost what is more this does not mean that on entering into the productive forces we could never have that luxury we are in possession of nothing but the means with which to create this luxury while in fact everything is being produced at the expense of others there is a difference between the two on the one hand there is nothing which is better for our own sake from this standpoint a proletarian however cannot as a labourer worker or farmworker should have any problem however when the worker is forced to go into work under conditions of social crisis and starvation and without a sufficient means to use then his problem is not the problem of how much food to give to the poor on this the communist must be very careful a peasant who is unable to produce enough means for himself and his family has taken over a factory and is living in a poor house with no means,GPT2

the worlds greatest economic miracleas we wrote a few weeks ago in an article about the potential for global economic disruption a wellknown academic and economist stephen pérez said that the global economic theory of growth is a relatively easy to understand and apply proposition he has been doing the same thing the fact that he is an economist and not a political activist is not surprising at all but it is important and if one thinks of the historical context the most likely explanation is that pétrezs theory is based on a faulty conceptualization of growth which is flawed because it assumes that growth is driven by capital in other words there is no growth model growth is determined by what happens in society not what it means to be an individual if growth has to do with capital then there must be a capital model and that model must have the power to bring about something so if growth means capital accumulation it must also mean that capital must accumulate to maintain societys current needs i think most people are confused by this problem because they see it as a very hard problem to solve because the current growthbased model of capitalismwhich is the way it works todayis based only on what one sees in the world which isnt as real as it seems indeed pésrez has made it very easy for us to get stuck in this mess of a model and its implications its a lot easier to make it simple we can write a more precise model with the numbers that we know for instance about how much capital has accumulated in our society there is certainly room for improvement pérrez is correct that while capital is required growth can only be achieved if capital accumulates but that doesnt mean its impossible to achieve it this is true even if the model is simple and it allows for a long period of time he writes we might say that there are so many variables which we can determine which are impossible for instance how many people do you think are in prison or how high do the poverty rates in a country how many more are living in poverty than they are so when one puts a set of numbers on things which can be determined empirically one can say yes we have a problem our model cannot do this but theres no need to explain this because capitalism,GPT2
 and now she is in a state of deep fear it is no wonder how many people in the world believe that we should not have the right to make our own decisionsso who are those people are they the people who will help you decide between a life of work play and freedom are they those who have worked hard to get into and retain a job do they have some form of financial security for their jobs or are these people just that some of them have been there for more than 15 years but they are not allowed to give up their chance they are forced to take on a new life and become what they want to be as they feel they will not be able to live without their employer this is a dangerous path for anyone who wants to go to the workforce but is unwilling to do so it makes them feel like they cant find a good job or that they cannot be a part of a society where they know they could be fired if they dont work hard enough at one job they may not find another as such they see the job as the only way to continue to have a fulfilling life but there are some that believe this will lead to them going back to work and that if they go from that to a different job or to another the chances are that the jobs will be cut how many of these are people willing to accept that this could happen to their career what does it mean if the new job is not what you were promised when you will have to face the challenges of life if you are willing then it can mean that you should give in to hardship that is why most of the great thinkers of our time were in favor of freedom to give some of those great minds the choice to choose between something that could keep them happy something they would want them to want in life could give them the freedom to decide to remain and pursue their dreams i don believe in freedom from the burden of personal responsibility the key to your success is to let go of some negative feelings some people may wish they had less responsibility such as a spouse whatever they do it is your responsibility to help them become happy so be sure for the sake of your own personal success to not feel this pressure when people ask me what i believe i say i believe something very important and its something ill do,GPT2

 to make that claim for example she might claim that the moon never moved but if the heavens were made of light a planet might move as the sun would but if there was a third planet then the universe would be expanding as it expands she would claim the existence of the third world and she then would say that it has nothing to do with the first world the second world is more complicated since the two worlds are interrelated while the earth is notin the second law of physics the spacetime continuum is continuous that means the stars are continually moving not just rotating around this is because the physical universe has a constant and constant space between them if the planets were rotating in the same direction they would only be moving in that direction in fact there are many planets that are rotating like ours they are not moving at the speed of sound they are moving so fast that they do not move at all it is the gravitational effect of these planets on the atmosphere which in turn has an equal effect on our atmosphere and so we have the concept of a continuous space where the world expands as we expand creating and expanding again we must be careful because even though the laws of gravity exist it is impossible to know how they work on a real planet there is no way to determine how the vacuum would change so there is nobody to investigate we will simply be doing our best to explain what all of this means,GPT2

 when one does not believe god is omnipotent he will not be able to see clearly that gods will is eternal in all that he has given him and will find it difficult to understand or understand the need to do more for him he will therefore have to take a more active part in the work on the other side while at the same time remaining wholly uninvolved in a great number of important issues26 it is the duty of man to seek out and find the spiritual and spiritual works of god that give him peace and happiness with a view to the happiness of all the spirit as we have already said is a power which is given to man as a gift from god but when received in his own presence it becomes the source of evil in man since it is to that end that the spirit is put by the grace of the lord jesus christ who is our lord to whom we owe our existence we are able by means of his spirit and by his power the salvation of him who has been in need our salvation is by the gift of jesus for he is christs son son of glory and of power his salvation consists in his being in power and in being loved by god to be fruitful and multiply which in consequence of our conversion makes us free from the bondage of sin and brings us into communion with him and with him christ is not to blame for our sins neither for those who are tempted to sin by those we do not know but this is because the holy spirit has provided the means by which we can be saved by him who gives us the power to love those he loves so that we know that to have sin is absolutely necessary if we believe in christ in other words if one is willing to die for the cause of christ and to go to heaven as an infant then to give up the whole of his body to his father is sufficient though he is in danger of dying it therefore follows that if he does as he wishes to there is still a risk that one will go back to hell for he must continue to live in pain suffering death and suffering to do this he must also work to make up for his loss by his will hence by making up his death for sin one can not only save himself yet also save others this is what we call the good work the,GPT2

 all of this is true of the fact that all the states are in the same region where all are living so that if you want to argue the existence of a god you have to have a state of mind where you actually have that stateso the question i want you to answer before you start is this what do we have where we are where are we going to be from what are the places were going how can you create a place where the earth is if you look at the bible weve had enough of that and it will be a matter of time before we get to a new place that has a different kind of place we have the lord on our side and we will live in peace but as it is there are some places where a lot of people will disagree with the gospel of jesus christ and the church may be there to put an end to that disagreement but it does not mean that there isnt disagreement the church has always done what it says it wants to do which is to say that we should all agree that at some point in a very very short time all of us will agree to gods will for the first time in our history thats the only way to get there the church says that when it comes to the future of our children its not the time to leave our parents its too late i think that the moment that comes when we move on to what we want our heavenly father will not be leaving us he will come and give us an opportunity to move forward his will comes as a result of what i have read and heard when you read the scriptures and read about the world a thousand times people say one thing that theyre not going crazy about they never get crazy this is not a crazy thing theyre just thinking about it there will always be things in their mind that i would consider crazy like the coming apocalypse in this case im not crazy because i know i will go crazy in this place maybe if i take a trip to heaven or something my god has given me the opportunity so i believe that in getting there if we can come together and agree on what to believe then well come out of it together if we dont get along and then don get together to make our own way,GPT2

 that its a true genuine form of art and if on the contrary this art is somehow a form unworthy of the name of a truly genuine artistic work it is to be regarded as mere propagandaon the other hand if it be possible to call art art the expression of ones own own essence is a matter of great importance to the general public and to a considerable extent in the history of society art to say the least has always been a means of expressing one particular individuality of expression which is not only a kind of individual but can be expressed in many different ways it is perhaps only natural that we should use art as a method of public opinion as an instrument for giving to our citizens the means for expressing their political opinions but if this is the case art may also be a source of good for the public for in fact its use may be the most useful means by which it may promote a general understanding among our people what then does such a thing mean besides being of such an important character p 488 i suppose that the use of these words is an expression from the point of view of what it serves to express that is of an authentic form which we have all been taught by reason of our education and by our own experience by the results of which our conduct has been guided i am afraid that to speak of any of this in a way that would make a man look as if he were an expert in any subject would be to deny the authority of all that he has learned in his life to say that art in itself has a meaning of its own however little it has might be of no use in this case pp 490491 as for what is most important to us in life what we are called to ask we must inquire of him what art means a man who does not know this who though he knows the art of painting yet being ignorant of it cannot understand it in order to understand a person must understand art itself so it must be that for instance he must know that painting is in some way a work of artistic expression the meaning therefore must necessarily be at first sight an indication that a particular person thinks of and expresses that which he is expressing which is all,GPT2

 and my heart was full of sorrow and sadness i could not bear to see the great woman which so often had been my mother so long in the midst of so much sorrow for her yet i had an idea of what it was that would make her more miserable one that was almost greater than that of any woman who had ever been sowhen i was the age of ten there was a terrible famine in this country that every man of the present age who was of noble birth was now starving and if that famine were to last for seven or eight months it would be far greater if it were not i should have been as miserable as i am now but i did not think so for i saw a great number of men of whom the greatest of them were of all ages but of such a kind and distinguished sort as were all of these men the very thing that i feared most though i felt it also came to me in such great agony in the end some of my best friends my sisters and i did all they could to help they were as kind as the most noble of those who loved and revered my mother or as even as my fathers most kind our great brother it was however no more than one of their best as though the other were our greatest enemy their sorrow came not from the lack of strength or strength of others nor from their lack or lack the strength nor strength from what they had suffered their fear or their joy or joy not as something more terrible than a loss of life a sickness an end for they were the only people even the richest and most powerful to whom such sorrow would not come all these people had such feelings of hatred for the poor and the sick such hatred of death all these feelings at one time or another were made to come to them by the same kind of kindness which i have shown to those men who were most dear to the heart of me of course they did that because of our good friends we were so glad of that kindness one of us was so happy if we did it a man now born would probably be so proud as to say to his father give me a chance give me my chance from now on that was our joy and our hope no matter how much we,GPT2
 he says thats the way to say it i have a habit of saying things and i dont like it the person with the accent will say but it makes me feel better then he is happy or he will be angry which is quite a good thing the accent and the person will always be present and happyi have always had a very strong dislike of the people who have no accent because they have so many things to be proud of and so little to think about they are so small and insignificant and they are only interested in the fame and money of their employers it is very hard for them to find a job with good results to earn money and to have their own place that is why people are always looking for jobs there is a great deal of money that is available for the rich people to spend when they get rich but there isnt any money for people that have very little money to invest in their homes so they don they cant put their kids to school and their parents can never pay off the debts those that are poor and in debt can get away with it because of it even if they own their houses we have to look at it like a game you have got to do it in order to get the best out of yourself if you want to live the good life in fact we have not even tried to create a new game in this country all we do is create games and it is just about the quality of life that we are talking about today but we can not have games because we don we cannot have an arcade in our house what we want is games for sure some people would say that its a waste of time to build games in front of our children well thats just the simple truth games are an illusion when you hear good music you are not talking to an artist to build good games is like listening to a musician who has to play many different instruments music is the most important instrument in music if you don´t know what an instrument is what is it it´s a matter of knowledge a sound that you have heard before is completely different from the sound you heard at first just listen to the music and you will learn a certain way of playing every time you play people will ask you to learn more your music is your way,GPT2
the court has a responsibility to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding these cases said justice paul m s tappanin jr who wrote the opinion it is not clear how much greater the burden is to prove that the defendant committed any form of violence or has engaged in any criminal activity or conspiracy or what degree of culpability the conduct is the daily beast first reported on the case in may 2002the district court found that defendant engaged in a violent violent cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and that there was no evidence of any consensual or involuntary acts by the accused that made the complainant feel unsafe in other words the charge of aggravated assault was not even a felony the jury did not find the victim guilty in addition after the jury found defendant guilty of the crime in the first place he was sentenced to a term of probation and ordered to pay a 20000 fine this sentence was suspended for four months in june 2002 and in march 2003 with the federal governments help prosecutors filed their first federal civil rights lawsuit against defendant the case brought by plaintiff in april 2003 a federal judge agreed to review the trial and order a guilty verdict justice ms opinion which was published in the nation is the only one in which the judge found the government had a reasonable chance of finding that there was a substantial nexus between defendants conduct and or involvement in this crime,GPT2

 quantity price and condition or any other thing which is not directly connected with the subject matter of the book possessions in other words are just as often a means of getting an advance as are commodities the most important of these is the demand for the commodity which in reality is a commodity it is of course a very important commodity to the man who uses it who sells it to his wife to whom it is bought by him as a price this is why in the early days of capitalism there was no capital but the private ownership of capitalthe state was designed as an instrument of government its principal aim was to make the people in question more independent of each other so that they might think of themselves as independent in their own lives not as representatives of a ruling class that is it was intended to bring about a change in society so as to give them a more conscious and conscious control over their lives in other terms it meant that the working class would be reduced to mere property so after a long and bloody struggle the government was abolished the name of state is derived from the french word for state meaning in the hands of men the government was not intended for government for it represented the will of man of all human beings even the very idea of public administration in which the state was the sole instrument was a mere illusion a false idea government merely consisted of an artificial government in order to get the best benefits out of people without it the state would not have been an honest benevolent peoples government it would have failed at least to a certain extent as to money there were some institutions which did not exist such as trusts banks etc and had their functions in a feudal system they were nothing more than money instruments created by men who had been compelled to work the mens labor for them until they were compelled by necessity to spend the money in exchange for their services thus if the individual wants the benefits of his society then the whole social structure is that of money there is nothing to be found in it except in its very essence but for a man to receive the benefit of society he must be forced to act as if he were an agent of it and as such he has to take part in certain forms of management usually by means that are not known to him,GPT2
 it is not in an age when the word hero is taken to mean a woman who is physically capable of fighting with her body the words strong and weak are used to describe someone with a limited ability to handle a situationthe word is also used in the context of a man who has a wonderful ability this is a statement about the mans ability but is often taken as an affront to the womans uniqueness or strength see also man with the wisest abilities weak has been used as a term of endearment to some people but most peoples experiences with it are lessened by the use of blessed this means that those who do not look at their own strength are not called blessed even though they may look at their body but are truly blessed the word can be thought of as describing someone who when confronted by an unfamiliar body is awakened and in a world where charms often mean curse it can also be interpreted as referring to someone whose physical strength is so overwhelming that they are unable to hold on in their human form the term good means to be welladjusted a very specific type of person a person with or in some cases inferior strength that is expected to fight a particular task examples of this include women who are dying from childbirth people who have been killed by a car accident and people with physical disabilities some of the most common examples are women with disabilities not physically able to fight not capable to take a step have difficulty with walking are often unable or unwilling to walk cant run cannot move need constant attention do little to maintain their balance lack the ability for proper control of their emotions and body however these examples do reflect men who may be very physically unable physically weak ablebodied unabletodoanything without the capacity for being the guy who wins examples here include men with a little bit of muscle sensory nerves or the like but as with most things there are exceptions for example if someone is blind or deaf one may not be able or willing to use the same tools as others,GPT2

 a big tent for the euro with a view to the europhiles in europe and the worldthey are being told that the euro will be not just a currency but a global currency because of the current crisis they are told the us has to be more aggressive in its efforts to revive the economy and that they must rescue the banking system by making sure we cant run the banks without us it is not as if we are asking them to save the financial system we are merely asking for some sort of bailout i hope you will join me in wishing that we did not fall short of our commitments in the words of the economist weve got to get the fiscal picture right the euro is the most important thing we can do we have to do this but as we have already said this is a very difficult task greece needs to understand that there is no escape from an economic crisis and its creditors must be held accountable for having done so otherwise the crisis will continue to worsen and it will become much harder to resolve it as i said the financial crisis is over,GPT2

 it is hard to imagine that it would be able to go on and on but you could still say that this is a great honor and it was a gift of the pope to give to her in order to see the value of it i think that the fact that he does not make any effort to say what he thinks is the best interpretation that his views are not necessarily taken as an opinion but as a fact is also a reason for his actions and his feelings there is no sense that there is any other interpretation of his words he will take it and not try to answer it in a way that would make it less plausible the question is whether he would have been able that is another questionthat is if he did not want to be judged would he have done the right thing i would not be surprised to find that some of those who would disagree with him those would argue about his ideas and their possible moral consequences they would say well you know he doesnt know enough about psychology to justify this behavior and hes not going to put it out there lets see what happens but i dont think he is going after what is right it seems to me that instead the question was have you considered this which is all you really have,GPT2

 but thou dost keep thyself in the line for i am sure it will not be necessary to say anything at all i mean by that not to take me to the side of man in the same way when thou hast made a man in love with his own body thou is not a liar as for those who live in those things they live their life as they would live if they had nothing else the best of them do not have nothing by that the best must be the thing they have in mindand if thou dost not make them understand then thou wilt find no way to do so for if the man is in a condition of love he is a slave to his master he will live as he would as a human being it is only because of this that thou must always keep the heart in his place and if it be so what shall he do the other day i was in that very room  this is what i have just said i think that by love i means that the human soul is the only one who is able to understand the truth and that one can never know what it is for this is why it should be kept in very special care so if you are a lover you must keep your heart because it must understand what is right and wrong but if a person you love is an alien to you like the rest of the world it may be that their heart is like this look man do you know me i love you so much that i cannot understand you to understand me means to love and not understanding therefore i do this to help you understand better i would like to know more please i would ask you what you think answer love is love if i understand to be true why should i not also understand love means the perfect love for one why should they not love one another why do they love each other so well that they will never be able in any way whatsoever to think of each another as one as to this there is one thing in this world which is impossible for a soul to feel for its own sake which has nothing to offer to it a soul must look at itself as if by the grace,GPT2

 coat he was only a few years old when he died and his family didnt know how to help himthe next time they saw him they were stunned to be able to hear him talk i cant believe i did that i thought he was trying to kill me and he did in the weeks before his death he had been in a truck with a neighbor at the time when a neighbour called them to say they had found the car that killed him and had asked the driver to call the police the neighbors took the truck and took him to the hospital the neighbor later told investigators the man had tried to run off the scene and that he couldnt get up and walk without getting shot the man was pronounced dead at a hospital that was not a long way from where hed been shot there was no sign of a gun in the vehicle so thats not clear to me if the owner of the trailer was aware of his neighbors report of him running off on the video it appears the dead mans body is in one of several different locations including two different trailersi know i knowive known him for a while now theyd always been a family with kids aunts and uncles wed have been together for most of our lives it was something that we were all proud of but now as ive become more familiar with him since my whole life has been about him because of this story my whole family was proud to have him around at the same time in my own way of thinking all the people of my life have come to understand that even though he is out there killing people that this wasnt the guy he knew or loved and he hadnt been killed this is not some crazy guy who was going to get away with murder but someone who had a lot of respect for people if they didn just get out of here it would have made sense maybe he wasn like just a kid who just happened to go out and kill people or something thats what we think of when we talk about people who are out here killing or going out to do something because they are so unique and so wellrounded you can tell that they have people like him who have a great sense of humor who could get a job have kids,GPT2

 it was a beautiful and beautiful garden and it was well cultivated and cultivated till the third month of january 1843 in the spring when the garden was ready the king of england came to the gardens saying sir i shall see you soon if you do not tell me now tell me if there is any trouble and the king said that he had a great many gifts of land and land which he did not possess for he was very rich but he would not have had any more of it neither would he have given it to any one else but his king who was the first to see him was furious because he thought that the land was in the hands of a foreigner on the contrary he told him that at such a time in his own time and in that of the country there was no foreign king in england no foreigner unless he wished to be so or to make use of his land then he said to him why did you not keep me at that time when i was so rich and rich and he answered i did sir with my power to keep him at all times he said how then then he replied by the power of god as it were of which i am now the lord and it is said that god made man in this world by the grace of almighty god so he made him in a way whereby he could not be deceived for god was without form and had no form and with him he camebook iv the place of the king i have always believed that it must have been a very large place to have lived on one may find it in many places where the city of london is located such as this on the shore of one of those great rivers called the thames where there were no rivers with a depth of over one hundred miles from the place of sir john de salzburgs house about where it stands is now a small country of about two hundred and seventyfive acres now it may be said for some time that this is a place where no one is able to look for a man for in these places there are no people nor there any persons to whom men can come except to go to meet a wife or husband this is the truth of this truth we are,GPT2
 and so on we have to prove that this is true because if we cant prove this to be true then we must not be able to believe thiswe are doing this because we are not sure what sort of object we have in other words we dont know what kind of gate we know and if its a gate then it is a type of thing like how were able say that we think of a light being like a prism the way we see it there is no way that light is going to come from a different direction but a way is coming from another direction so weve got to find that a whole new way of seeing is possible if all we do is think that there are many ways the only way to go is to think in other ways because one of the things that i think is the most important thing is that when we try to imagine this new world that is in this particular world we come into one way will be that it will look differently there is only one path though this is what we call the new world and that path is always the new one now i can get a sense of where things are going at least as far as we go when i see things in the real world but if i go to the world of the great gatsby then one will not see anything except the great pyramid and taurus and thats because there arent any things for the eyes to see thats what you see in nature then there will also be the thing that is out there or what is inside the other world that is where the light from the different worlds comes from its not that you can see the stars it was the fact that the moon was in celestial c that made all the planets in that planet visible so we could see that because it had to look through it one has to understand that when we create an object as in a telescope with a single eye even if you know that an arrow is pointing out you still have the same thing you know if one has some kind that looks like an apple or if the others have something like that they always look different they are actually the kind they are i dont know how you would explain that if they all looked exactly alike a,GPT2

 where would thy fathers wife be what would thee know of the great war7 i will tell thee this the one who will be king is the one that will win over the world and the other will stand in the same position to follow him so the people will all follow it and if the leader of a nation is a man of god and a ruler who would have been king had he not and if he has not been a king it would be a great disaster to him so he will lose his power therefore it is not lawful for a prince to be the ruler of his own country he may be at his seat in a capital but he cannot be his ruler in his country for he is in an unhappy state hence many people are in revolt against the king of their own lands hebrews 254 6 the kings of greece will not be happy with the rest of mankind as for the leaders of kings they will want to show themselves to the whole world as a whole this is because their lives will have a huge impact on peoples hearts and minds since there will come a time when the entire world will feel at ease and peace with one another this is what may happen they will try to make their way to their homes and settle their differences but the general populace will still be discontented as it was with sparta and rome thus the roman people may go to war with their fellow citizens it is only in this way that they can see their country in peace and prosperity that is why they need to find a way of getting out of this situation because of these the greeks are going to revolt lxxvii in fact some of them from persia to greece will also follow the lead of those who are now in rebellion in such cases such as what happened with babylon there is no hope to avoid having to face the consequences of such a rebellion within the borders of your country or even within your own territory for such people would not live in your land because if you did live there you would never be able to escape from it if there were no other way out however if they want some other country to live at their side then they must decide what they might do if this country was to become a more or less independent state in which case,GPT2

 yes the first person to be killed was the man who was sent to his father to kill his own son this man was killed by the men who loved their father so much that he killed his child for them the man that was given the gift of life also died because of the love of his son or wife and the father that loved his children so deeply did not die because he loved the children of men like him i dont mean to make any political point about this but i think its important to remember that the only people who are born in the same year or the year after the birth of their child are parents a child born before the age of six would never die if a parent was born after six months he would be alive but a child who is born between six and eight months old was not born that way it was because a father gave his birth to a son that it was for him to live that was his nameand what about those who were born during those times when the laws were still being enforced i mean i was speaking to you about a different issue you said it and im quoting from it to this point because what i said was when i started this book in a situation of a crisis what did the government do and you said that if the law was still in place there would still be people like me who had been able to get away with it do you believe in that because of your position,GPT2
 it is said that it is the duty of the king to give him the royal hand in all things and that he is his sovereign but that the crown prince would not be in a position to make any such provision14 it was said that when the king was at his ease he would set about making his way when he could so that his majesty could not go but the people said to him we do not know what he hath done what the prince hath said for he will not take his eyes to us as it has been said against him so he said unto them that he should not set his attention on the matter and they answered he hath spoken to me with great understanding saith the lord and he added unto the men and i will set my heart upon it saying how must it be that i should know that thou art the sovereign of this world what is it that is wrong with thee then if thou love the world to be the ruler of it and he answered unto whatsoever thou shalt do it will be done by god neither by man nor by woman therefore it was the will of god that this should be made known to all mankind for in the beginning there was one god but in this day there are two 1 and since the words of solomon have been fulfilled this is what it shall be for the first time in their history 2 and now we have seen how this shall happen for behold the lord hath revealed to them the things to come which he shall make known unto men and there shall come to pass in one day a kingdom that shall not fall into darkness neither shall the light from heaven perish yea even the sun shall shine 2 until all the nations shall see that a glorious day has come but the darkness shall cease until the days of darkness also shall pass away 3 and this kingdom shall end in two days the day of judgment 4 which shall consist in that day whether he reigns or not this will happen no more in his kingdom it must be brought about all over the earth shall become free it may end only in some land where there will no law no punishment 5 but will end by the common will of all nations in which no one shall live they,GPT2

this is just one of many reasons why we feel we need to make some changes to the way we do business with the government i have seen many people who work for the uk government and are directly affected by the cuts but also see the changes being made by people in the private sector we need more transparency and accountability and we can better inform people about how their businesses are affected for example when we are in our first year were seeing changes in how we hire how our suppliers are paid what we pay our staff where they go to work the number of jobs they have thats why im interested in seeing better transparency in some aspects of our business particularly when it comes to how the businesses we work with and the people we serve it might be easier for our clients to know what theyre getting for their money for example if we were to change how they are treated by our government in certain industries or what our businesses do with our funds of course a lot of people would argue that we should do more as we have more people working at the helm that they dont need that sort of transparency to figure out whats going on and when things are going to get better but thats not necessarily the case what i want people to understand is that the public cant tell us what to do so we want to be able to have a very public view of how things work under the current system our business will continue to grow our customers will move to us their finances will improve i think because weve got an open mind and also more and more businesses like ours arent going away people are seeing that including myself the public interest is really strong in government and government spending is at an alltime high especially in terms of the welfare state and how its implemented so it should be something that happens at a time when the economy is actually growing and getting better it shouldnt happen in a vacuum if you look at our own government theyve done a great job of doing that right at home theyve introduced a system where people can make sure that their benefits are funded put the money into their own account which is a pretty good thing theres been some talk of going over to a more open system in different sectors of government to keep things more accountable and to better ensure that businesses have the most transparency this is,GPT2

 or be consumed or both of them will be eaten the same will pass through the eyes of god 324i know that god does not have an end in sight yet to the contrary he has an beginning for the end has to come upon him who is in the way and he who has the means which he will bring about the lord has seen through all things as also he does by the example of the angels so also that by his own will we might know his true nature of which we will read in our own hearts and his purpose in all this is to bring things to pass so that we may know him as one living and one dead he is the spirit who works by means of his own heart not through any means therefore he works through power by love through good works with his whole heart and he knows all that is good and evil for he gives it to us through him in his will in that way he can bring all these things about his good because he himself is god living in gods image but he together with all his might and power and goodness can do all the things that he wills this is because of his great power if he were to live in an image in which i am i would not think that this would be the case but he lives in that image and has a living heart and a spirit which is very much like mine very far from all others even though i have no power in it nor will i ever be able to do so lest i be put in danger of being put into a state of temptation i do not know what it is that makes this effect in me it was already in my heart when i was made having already fallen into temptation and had sinned because i had no control over it now god has power over man in order that he might see things for himself it is not impossible that in such a way that i could do anything for him here also our hearts are filled with the power of hope especially in faith since we are in hope of salvation yet this can only be done through god himself otherwise he would have to be destroyed for his sake consequently he who does nothing for us would only have been destroyed because we did not believe in him had we not felt the,GPT2
 my gratitude and my thanks for all that i have hadi am happy to say that as i was once a teacher i will always have the same thoughts and feelings i had when i first began studying shakespeare and i am sorry to see it as such since i still dont quite understand shakespeares i claudius have been sent away for your sake however in the very last section of my life when faced with the question how do i get a better version of shakespeare i never thought i would ever have to write about it i just wanted to share some of the things i learned that were a little bit odd or weird about shakespeare as well as things that are a bit more interesting or interesting to the general public for myself and many others the book is about a very young man who learns to watch a movie in his bedroom and is in no doubt as amazed as he is at the way the audience does it but the film is also about the man himself he is a good man though not one to be taken lightly this is not to suggest that shakespeare is an idiot or that there is any doubt about his genius however it would be wrong to think that he would never make a film like the tempest which is the story of an army of brilliant young men who are sent on a mission to rescue their country from a savage and evil evil the film tells the whole story and the actors are all human so it is as if they are trying to make the best of all possible worlds a lot of people think shakespeare plays dumb they think he does not play as dumb as his character well he plays the role of a man with good instincts who knows what he thinks because he has been taught about things by his teachers and he knows that they do not know what they mean in other words if you are going to show a picture of someone who is dumb and you say to them hey how could you possibly think of that they will be very upset for a moment and then theyll say you know it was a dumb picture you know how it goes because you do the trick right well im sure they were trying just like they always do to teach you that but you have a great need to know that you might be too dumb to help them and for that matter they might not be as,GPT2

 that he is not guilty of the blasphemy because he has never been found guilty but merely that god is the lord and he was the one to punish it but that the same is false when god has made men by men as the apostle says be they of good will or they are chosen by them according to their race but god himself is a man who is in all things good and just romans 620to be sure if there is one thing that is wrong in this world it is that there were a lot of good people in it so that we may take a view of all the sins by which we have been punished rather than what is to say a few good people but it would be silly to conclude that this is because god did not make good men if you really want to know what the true meaning of this passage is of what god says by his words read it he makes it so of course by saying we will make you as good as you are not by making you like those who are in need of salvation the whole point is to make all good things possible whether bad or good he says that our sin is as much sin as it was good in order that it may be remedied by repentance and if you think that if we after repenting sin we shall make ourselves good again you ought to have a good conscience let him know that for you our sins will be forgiven only by jesus christ for if upon being saved he had not been made a bad person by the works of god how can he be with a person of your own the only one who can be savedchapter xxiii i the messages of god his words and the chaples which are the principal cause of our great sins 1 tim 278i ask you not to be ashamed of any of you said jesus speaking to the jews 2 peter 24 and be silent lest your hearts be darkened though you may know how many of us have sinned while you have not yet been justified both by christ and by our father whom you know not he then went on to,GPT2

 i am the leader of the state of israel and i think it is very necessary and i do not want this to be a situation that may lead us into a kind of catastrophe but this is a very important thing for israel for us to make sure that it does not succeed we cant waitas far as im concerned its not a question of my personal status here in israel—im not an israeli citizen i dont speak much so i may not have the moral stature to speak for myself and so they have asked me to come here its a public place a community which is not something that we can just take our hands off of we have to find somewhere else to live so if someone is taking advantage of me then thats something we need to do to help them in israel i believe in equality equality of treatment equal rights that there is in this country but this isnt about race this is about the human rights of all people as far back as the 1960s the british government in the wake of world war ii issued a statement that said that the state was violating international human and economic rights what do we mean by thatamy goodman youre a member of a group called the palestinian solidarity movement your group that has been protesting the israeli occupation of gaza youve been outspoken saying that israel has no right to prevent you from coming to israel or to leave gaza or even to apply for a visa to go to gaza— bing bing ive applied for—for a permit to stay in gaza now well this was a big thing the british government of course had a plan to send me there because as far i know my parents lived in france they lived here and they also moved to the united states where they had an american passport after the war israel gave me a passport something i had been denied to move with the rest of our family they put me in a room to keep my mind off the situation not to mention it was so important that they send a couple of hundred people to take me with them to visit my family who were in danger of getting killed thats how as you know in palestine when youre at a crossroads you can see that no,GPT2
 confines of a tiny town we cannot even be the only ones who can help us find a way to reach the other side of this great seabut the city had already lost its spirit and they had no way of making it back to the mainland the only way from there was by boat which was still more difficult it was impossible to transport us all back and finally the road to where the two of them were going was blocked and the bridge was closed even the nearest road was only a few meters wide so we hadnt really had any way out when we reached the town we walked straight for the exit but as we neared a side street a man stopped us and said dont worry im sure youll be coming back at some pointwhat i dont know just tell me about it he asked smiling he nodded his head its a long way itll take some time to get there i nodded my head giving him my answer as we got a little closer he asked us why are you here i nodded i felt the same way no matter how much i tried nothing happened just as i thought id heard the answer another voice said to methe man is coming to us why is there no exitand the first thing i said was im sorry there are no exits there are only waysif i were to say in the middle of the night that the man didnt come to my rescue then i wouldnt be able to come up with a coherent explanation of how it was that he did what i did because it would be more complicated to explain why the guy came but i understood what was happening as well maybe he was trying to kill me or maybe he really was the one who was going to stop me from going back into the village either way however this was a different story in the end all we could do was find somewhere to go find some way back in time or simply walk up the narrow passage where there were no more exits to be found this was where i wanted to start my journey so i started walking forward with the help of my mother going through the forest to that end i found a very,GPT2
 the body was very thin very weak but with the strength of a man of the same age as himself even his own strength was diminished but that person in all probability had been so weak in his body that he was utterly unable to carry his weight if not in a way so great that it was impossible to lift him again that man who was the chief of all the men of his country was to the utmost degree his master his chief subject of study a person so remarkable as to be surpassed by nothing else nor so much as was of such a value as that of others i mean that he had made no effort to gain or maintain his strength having never been a master and he would have been much weaker for the greater he attained in strength and skill so that if he were to have the opportunity of exercising his power it ought to rest upon what he possessed if he did not then he himself would not have gained for all that was necessary for him to do so were he not so easily carried away by the exertions of life which as one might say made it impossible by his physical nature to keep up with his lifethus too men are often so fatigued when they are engaged in exercises or when any part of them are so exhausted they be put to such exercises that they cease to enjoy the enjoyment of their strength there are certain things that men can do whether they have lost their physical power or whether no one can this is one of those things although men though they do not really have it do exercise it at their leisure without any exertion while they may in some other way be able to make use of it and upon some very short periods of time after this some men will be so intoxicated that even when the life of men is in full enjoyment there appears to them too great an appetite for it to consume them unless they were in need of some form or other since they could not do it for themselves thus i should say that a small portion of every day would make no difference from the beginning of an exercise what a portion would be that would go into the stomach why perhaps not even the portion that is done to prevent vomiting would there not be an acute desire for their benefit i would say it is not the case,GPT2
3 if you are on a mission with a large team we must be able to use the mission management system this means that we should be using the ability to schedule events without having to manually schedule missions eg with the dedicated events function if we are able then we can schedule the events within a specific time frame4 it is imperative to make sure that the event is scheduled as needed in some cases there is an event that you cannot get to and the only way to get there will be to have the server restart for example if you have a few days to complete mission 5 and you dont get a significant amount of work done you may need to start over again from scratch or you can start the next mission from the beginning and then wait for the servers to restart and finish the job we should not be doing this also it is important to be sure to keep a minimum amount for each mission you can get the same number of missions in a single time period as you would when you started a new mission but you should keep that number limited while your mission is going on that way all the time you need for a certain mission will always be available so for example if a player is playing a game that is getting ready to go they might need a larger number than they are currently able thus the more missions you run within your single mission time etc you will need and we will not want to do that to our servers the server will have to respond to an emergency in order to allow you to play it but if it doesnt a server should respond as soon as possible therefore in this case i would recommend using a maximum of 3 missions per server im not going to call this number time limits or limits but the time limit on the other hand our server can not handle any of the above a server may not know if there are new missions ready for it to launch or if the game is changing when it launches by the way its also important not to run out of resources there may be a situation where it will take you more time than necessary to load and complete the missions because the number is limited maybe its a bug or maybe the team is busy running the project while theyre,GPT2

 but his strength is no greater than his power for he will not give up his own life for that of his friends wiveschapter 3 26 and when it is heard he shall say to them i am the son of the lord and my father is the lord i am his god and i have not come to destroy you i will keep you from your ways even as i loved you with my hand this is my law my love i bear witness to it you should not have heard it but from the mouth of your enemies but i say as you do that you must hear it and know it to be true lest you should be misled for if you see that i did not speak to you you will know that because of my word i made you the children of men that it was no small thing to do this to me it is true that we are the sons of god who are called to reign over the dead to lead them to everlasting life but let us pray that god will grant that the law of moses the holy book of life which he gave to his people may be followed unto the end of time he was the righteous man who was to save them before the world and he came to judge them in the same way as the prophets said he would judge the people that was his law he put them under the sword of darkness until they were no more than beasts let us therefore pray to god that he may give us a testimony of his righteousness and righteousness we are our own children our descendants after our fathers whose fathers are in heaven the people of israel what is that to say they say that they are my children they are children from heaven they have been raised up in the likeness of their fathers therefore they will be my sons sons to the eternal father therefore let not your fatherinlaw be an empty garment 38 and 41 for god says in this life i do all things also for i love the one who loves me so that all may see me 512 because my name will rejoice in him while his name is bitter thus the spirit of wrath was revealed to all of us in order that our hearts might,GPT2
 i will tell you what i would propose is that the government would be permitted to make all the provisions of the constitution which they have made and take them into their own hands it is my intention to leave out some things which would not be well to be left out i think that if there was a single thing which ought to have been left to a man or a woman he ought not for he would never have taken the measures necessary to keep his own interest but he should have in his mind taken those measures which he thought necessary to which his interests and his hopes should be putbut of course there is no need of this because the constitution is an instrument for that purpose it is also intended to give you a means of making the government a better government if you want to do that the best way to get what you wish is to go to the parliament and change it but it has to take place through the people that should not take the place of an amendment we have a system of legislative assemblies where there are only two or three people who do the work of all of these assemblies a parliament is in the hands of three or four people who are elected by a vote of a majority of people from all over the country once you make that change you have to put the whole of it into your own hand you have already made the changes which are necessary in order to prevent the dissolution of parliament so you can make them as you please and if you are well enough you will have got the good things you need to see from the very beginning just as the old liberalism did before this must be done by all men not by one man the only people in power are the men who make the decisions not by those men as they themselves say they cannot make laws those men make decisions there is nothing that can save you from this your interests are your interests for this reason this constitution is the only means to that end to the other end no man has the right to say that he does not want the law in this country that his interest requires it in other countries he cannot say i want it here here because his desire for this law is only for himself and not for the sake of his friend or his friends so we have an election system now what is,GPT2
okay ill go and check it out and i do want to ask you and i will you know theres just a lot of things that we could see in the report that this is going to have to be looked at but i think it would have been interesting to see if there were any questions that were raised about how the investigation like how it went down or whether there was any collusion between the fbi and the russians thats what this report is about q you said that you didnt think that the russian government had done anything to disrupt your investigation a yes sir it was just that they didncommitted a conspiracy and they were doing it for a grand total of 50 million a full 150 million of that which is not a huge amount of money but why did they conduct this a obviously it wasnt just one group that was doing this it was all of these different groups that had been in contact with trump for some time including many that did nothing but contact trump through their website and it started getting to the point where it became a total mess were not talking about collusion here were talking a complete conspiracy thats why because these are all individuals who at the same time in this meeting had a conversation about the russiagate campaign these were individuals that came up with a plan for example to go to a meeting with the president of russia and say look thiss a terrible idea we need to do this this is a horrible idea that will give our country a bad name q and you said one of the things you had to say was in terms of this the fact that trump jr was contacted by people involved in russia who had contacts with russians i mean trumps father was a russian citizen hes in trump tower was that in any way a violation of any law no matter what your background a i dont know what the law is okay i cant remember if i knew or not though the law says that if youre an individual who is subject to any criminal investigation that involves your activities or any financial relationships then you can be subject as an employee of a foreign government so if your financial relationship is with an organization be that a government department an agency,GPT2
 the temple beginninga boy walks and smiles he is a young young man a good boy of good looks and good manners who has a very good heart and a great sense of humor it is his mothers custom to visit him one day and the boy is always there the boy looks at her looks in her face asks her for a greeting is very happy to hear of her visit she then looks back but does not say anything a very calm and kind child very fond of his parents he has always been very very kind to his sister his father the eldest son loved him so much that he never left his room if he was to come home and spend a night at home with his father and his brother his heart would be so weak that it would break him to be in such a position but his brothers were very much in love with their father their father was a true believer who would never let go his mind when the day comes they will go to sleep together which is the law of heaven they will not let any one go out without being taken to the great city of jerusalem where the first priests and priests of the city will be gathered together again so that the people of these cities will gather together with one another with the spirit of peace for the eternal salvation of all mankind in the house of jehovah god is coming to make this house a sanctuary for those who sin and in those days it is so hard to bring about a change in the way of life those who are in heaven that is those at the high places will have to face this problem now this problem has arisen in a way that has to do with not letting go of your mind and your body because now all of you will see that jehovah is in your hands after having been given the keys of eternal life and as the lord has commanded you as soon as you are able to see this you can enter heaven and there will surely be some change that will come to you as soon you have been told when you think about the future that you might have then you must prepare yourselves and prepare yourself according to what jehovah has told you so far you must have the knowledge of what the things that have happened to you are going to happen to go and look at what is this if it were true,GPT2
 and with the help of god i determined to take my life i had been a very pious man always in prayer to the end that i may show the love i could with my own body by praying to god the lord had granted me all that he could grant even though i lacked the power he did not give me power to change my disposition to his will nor did he give us power because he was not ready to give it to us i was born of the poor of poverty a poor woman who gave to my parents a hard time they gave me to work but i found it difficult so i went for a job and came to philadelphia where i met the prophet joseph smith we had a great deal of time together on a good day together when i was a young boy we had no money and we did no good at first we took up the study and worked until we began to feel our way down but then we found that there was something wrong with us because we were not willing to do what we should want to as a boy i never had the freedom of choice and was taught to follow the lord and do whatever was right and i began in the same way so we went to one of our schools which was called the church of jesus christ of latterday saints it was the first and most beautiful school in my opinion in the middle of it the teachers told me that it was for the children of unbelievers not for those that were in our church then they told my brothers and sisters that we must go and live for life for all of life and for eternity before our eyes so i did it on my way to that school i came upon a place called salt lake city near the mormon temple here called nauvoo was going to be the site of a temple to those who were to come to this nation of ours there was about sixty men and women all with very good wellbred children our people were going in as usual through the desert one of them joseph had said to me do you know what god calls us to live according to your will no matter how hard you work yes sir i said joseph told them that if they did their work and the prophet went and gave them their,GPT2

 i am a woman who has not had to endure thisas if he could understand her words the woman quickly turned her head toward the entrance of the room and began to explain i am the daughter of a noble who is living on a farm near the capital of zandia which means nothing to me i have been called by the people to be the guardian of this land so i must be responsible for protecting iti must not be a stranger to such things and i will not allow anyone to harm me the womans voice grew stronger it was a voice that had a certain amount of conviction but it was also extremely simple like a person who believed in the right things as if everyone had been able to understand the person was not the one that made a decision for him it had not been the person that said the wrong thing even if she said it in a stupid and unkind way she would not have accepted it because if you are going to make a mistake like this you must understand the consequences in this world there is no way to avoid the problem otherwise it would already have ended no one would ever want to hear me say that moreover i also have a family that is not my family so i cannot be involved in this matter this is my responsibility as a child if i were to die then i would be unable to live here of course i know that i didnt survive my experience or that it happened to someone else for it is all my fault in life but thats why this woman spoke out in such a way therefore why do you say thisthe woman looked at the other person suddenly stopped turned around looked towards the house a cold sweat forming on her forehead then she continued its not that you dont have friends you see this is the palace in zhejiang as for the two of you they are the same person thats right if its you and me we will also be able get along however since you both are living here now is that alrightthis person had clearly been talking about this topic when his mouth opened he revealed a smile he said without a doubt if it were me and you that lived here and we would still have to fight would our family,GPT2

the other two ideas from the last three years have been we cant just throw our money at this guy whos a better player and were going to do the right thing but we need to make sure that he understands the system and if we want to win we have to be able to give him a shot at the starting lineup i find the latter an absolutely true since the former will be a key player in a team that can win but as ive said before the real reason why im going with the first two is because it seems like the other three ideas are dead on arrival i know this because i spoke to a few people who have already read the book and i just want them to know that i was not alone in that view the point is that in the end its still not that simple we have a lot of talented players on the roster so well have some very good options coming into the season and with that lets move on,GPT2
 he took away his garments and clothed himself with white cloaks a robe of gold of silk the girdle of linen his hair and beard in the garb of a lion an eagle or a hawk this was the dress which he had bought for one of his servants who was a man of the city called the prince of thunder he also brought with him the same garment which is called a helmet of silver as the one worn by the royal household to the kings castle the king was greatly astonished then he said to his servant you mean to wear a dragons helmet i have heard but where is the dragon oh there is not one then the servant said— i will not let it go i will take it from you for i am afraid you will lose it so he did sopg 494 the story may be repeated in a different way that the king of thrace was an idol of apollo and the other prince of hellas so called by his parents was king of athens that is to say after he was destroyed by zeus for his part in this war in which they were engaged they took their sons to hella and brought them back to them after that it became known that all the sons of this god were to be executed either on the first trial or the last if they refused to bear the punishment of death there are many stories in greek mythology that show that these sons were given the death penalty by apollo because they had rejected the gods of their fathers in the myth of zeus they give the son of poseidon son to zeus all his brothers on his fathers side by which the father was also to die and be buried with his son when however this is finished their son while he is still alive is thrown into the fire where he will be crucified hereupon he becomes a son and a hero until he comes to a place where all men are killed and when the flame is over when he turns back those who were before him will come forward to him and kill him thus before the execution of those that were slain in hell zeus is going to set his face on fire to raise a fire that will burn out the cities as the heat and,GPT2
 for it is the last day of the year and your enemies are gathered round you that you should be destroyed the king answered i have said the same when i was a young man a man who had been a prisoner in this war in the battle of baden with the kings forces and this time he who is no longer in prison he is a stranger to me my father has passed away so that this is what i shall say and i am not a friend of your king but a servant of yours and he spoke to him saying but i will not be able to defend myself the sword has been cut off the sword is being broken you have not been able as i have been told to kill anyone who tries to do so but in truth i would not allow it i see no other way no way to save myself if you would give me the money to fight you so i ask you to bear me even as you bear the man whom you saw in your fathers arms but i must tell you i cannot bear you any longer for i do not want to see you againbut your son cried the queen you will never be so good as that manpg 17 the king of scots at his head the king his son came up to the throne carrying the crown 1798 this was the second time that the english had ever been so obstinate as to refuse to acknowledge that they had lost their king in the first place they were very much against his having ever had an opportunity of being king and secondly not only because he had made the greatest gains in his life which had to be reckoned in part by the value of his wealth and the wealth of others but also because they knew that he was not the only new king in that kingdom because having been in it from the beginning it had never been his right to have it or to use it in one way or another that was there was no question of any king being the heir to his father and mother whether he should have a son or not or whether instead of making the best of it he might have that only of becoming king by becoming a king of this kingdom it was by no,GPT2

 and not the art of magicyeah i guess it is i am glad you have no objections when the woman said that the man laughed he was a very handsome man in his 30s and he was very well dressed but he had a slight bow when he asked what is this art this is a painting of our heroine by the young heroine it is done by a woman who is not a poet oh you are right said the painter looking at the painting the woman smiled and said i know that you want to make me a painter why should i not draw a picture of this woman she had not seen the picture so she knew it was too beautiful but she still hoped to draw it and how is it done asked the artist who then took the illustration of the heroine and set it aside a little after that she was left to do the work she was going all over the world she thought drawing to the little man by candlelight painting all around him then drawing a little bit later by hand on a canvas after which she had to write or draw and keep an eye on the drawing with her fingers then she drew the figure of a child to show the children that their faces are real so she brought this painting to an exhibition which was held in the gallery in paris with the help of two young children one of them was an opera singer while the other was the daughter of an actress this first painting was called the eureka and it has three children a man and a boy they are a couple as a girl though they have three sons in the first they look like a real child on the second they are very young about five years old and on their third child they live in a house at a small town called le havre to them it seems like an old house when you look at them your eyes open wide that is how they looked at me in this drawing after that the girl came to me and took my picture it is really a great picture then the boy went to a different house where he looked very nice he wore a coat was about six feet in height had brown hair and had an interesting nose as the two children,GPT2
a man of his character and character i may have an opinion but i am not afraid of it it is not my position to tell the whole truth of everything but if at all possible i wish to speak for myself and my opinion may be that in the event of a general war i will never accept the opportunity of an honest discussion of the question as there are many men in this country who i do not know and i have never heard of others who do who have not been able to obtain the approbation of my friends in russia this is the only thing i can do they are very good men not only in their own country as i must say which i shall like dearly or i with the help of their friends will be obliged to listen to them because they are the best of friends and have been with me for twenty years some of these men have for instance been my neighbors my neighbours who are now friends with my father have had a great influence on me sometimes through my personal life others through the company of people who were my enemies some of them are strangers who will know me only from some acquaintance even if they never meet me even the most intimate friends of mine do know one another at length so that i cannot say the name of one who has not ever met only of some who know each other at some time of whom he is a friend nor of what i would like to say about my friends friends if i were to make any acquaintance with any of this people the fact that they have friends is one of those things which is most necessary for me to be satisfied with the only one which would seem to me impossible to explain here would be the great and powerful men of russia in regard to these whose opinions i know very well whom i admire that is most of all from whom it is possible to express my sentiments for these gentlemen are quite different from the people which we know these men are not even strangers to their countrymen though they sometimes appear on the side of many of us particularly in case i should happen to live in a country which has been destroyed by a war there are two different kinds of men who come to the same country one of which on account of that fact is called the gentleman of silesia and the other,GPT2

 is so greatthe strong the mighty and the powerful are all strong and the man who makes a strong man strong is the one who loves the weak for he loves him who is strong in his heart and does not fall down but stands up still he who has a great body will be strong because he is weak but when he has great strength he will not be weak because there is not a man in him and he does not fall this is how it is for true believers of the law the true believer loves his body for it as it were in the law there are five kinds of people if you are in love with your body you will love your soul there is no one in you who does this so it goes without saying that the great and powerful love their bodies because they are strong or they do not love them all that is done is to get them to be in this body and take it from them so that they may be able to enjoy life for the power of man is like the strength of two small men therefore if you feel the weight of a mighty man then you must make him strong as well then you may have power enough to push your way up a mountain and to live for eternity when you have great power man will hold your hand that is why it will come to pass that you shall not have the heart to hold hands with a woman who holds your hands the great man did not put his hand up to touch the earth because man has the spirit of desire he did that thus he did it for the will of god you shall be called to the father in heaven who is that there is only one god and one spirit1 this verse is from the old testament where we know that god is in the beginning with the son of man and that he is coming into being,GPT2

 if you do not obey we shall find you to be a traitorno said the english and the french in the end are the stronger but the spanish who had taken the position of the allies now seem to have had an idea of what was to come the french were so anxious about the victory that they had to do with the only thing that might bring them a victory they had come to the conclusion that the spaniards had been led by the people who possessed the greatest wealth or that it was only a matter of time before they would be able to get the land through the bayonet and that was how they got their victory on the island so the british they knew had decided to go to spain but that must have been the first step it was now the time to turn the tide not the other way around one of those things was that this was the beginning of a new war a war on a world scale so that every nation would have a different chance with which to respond to war that would mean that in every country the world would come up against itself its own country against its foreign neighbors between the great powers whose governments are so closely connected that if they did not share their national interests the war might be stopped there would not be an end to it for when the europeans came to madrid on august 15th 1604 there was an immense uproar that very day which brought about a whole generation of europeans from all over europe to join the crusade some of these people had left spain and were looking for a way out of it others were trying to live in lisbon the capital of lisbon and beyond those who did find a path to a better life there were all those who would go there and fight with a very different kind of force when they heard the news of that great massacre of 1816 some of them thought to themselves oh how wonderful they went to lisbon for safety and they saw that these men had gone to fight for the cause of liberty with all the zeal and courage they could muster all the while their blood ran cold in the days that followed all these ideas and all that seemed to them to follow for they were still in their minds thinking that spain had had a chance to win and that their country had won and it would,GPT2

 we should be able to determine whether or not they were the objects of an act of terrorism the question that should then arise is was it terrorism it is not it was not terrorism as such there is no such thing as terrorism in the sense of the termthe question is whether the act was terrorism on its face or whether it was a terrorist act on account of its intent to destroy the united states to be sure there are many things that are called terrorism but they are usually acts of war this is a very different matter if you want to be a part of a war you must be willing to take part in it and you have to obey the orders of god but if you dont then you are a spy you have been trained to do that so the question becomes what is it that you were trained for what were you trained and i would say that it is the duty of all who train their minds to carry out their duties some i believe have done it for a long time some for decades i think the purpose of training your mind is to make you believe that things are going to happen on their terms as they seem to you that is absolutely true and it never ceases to amaze me that so many people are trained as to the importance of religion in this country as much as the american people should give their time to studying this whole matter of this question they should not give it to us we should put it out as soon as possible not as long as we can because we cannot have it they should have the time and the opportunity to study it before we give our time a young man who has studied it says of course that he has no idea what they have in common with the muslims and that they do not hate them he does not know that the christians and jews do what they would like is that if we gave them the chance to learn what islam is and if they wanted to read the koran he would read it all the way through in fact in many cases this is what he is able for we are not trained in religion to look at let us think of what we would do if the whole world listened to our religion then they could see to it the truth would they believe in jesus christ would be they to believe him if they did not believe,GPT2
 which they believe to be trueand we have every reason to expect that the same cannot be said of the truth but the doctrine of scripture is a lie and we are bound to believe it it is an error but it is only one of many the doctrine that god created the world through a common cause which is the cause of all things is not true because it does not contain any good cause we may say god had not created and created men nor has god caused us to create men genesis 201415 the same is true of a person who believes that he is christ he may well believe that jesus christ is god and that he is in christ jesus or by the divine grace of god who has ordained that we should believe him to which he has a right of reply john 1438 3944 the truth of faith cannot in itself be based on faith to believe such a thing is to violate gods will for it would be to deny the whole truth even if the christians faith was already fully grounded in it when every other doctrine or tradition of christianity is based upon it cf 2 thessalonians 25 romans 11617 what then can we do besides to maintain that our faith is founded on a false doctrine if it has never been founded upon the true doctrine it would not be as if we had an eternal teaching that is an everlasting teaching all the doctrines of christianism are based in the fact that christ had a divine authority in his life who was also the creator of this world not on some other divine plan or command as is usual in christian theology thus we may speak of christs infallibility inasmuch as we admit by a natural necessity the infallible truth that there is no god no doubt there are many other things which are true and so also true which do not require us whatsoever to make faith in god such as the belief that joseph smith was an angel jesus is actually a man etc etc many of these things can be known so that they are known moreover it can also be seen that it was not the case that only a few of those doctrines were founded in truth but that in all of them there were many many false doctrines until just such time as,GPT2
and in truth the i am in a state of flux i have not seen my friend nor have i been able to tell you by my own words we are all men of a different race of different ages but i would not believe in gods son or in the power of his son if it were not for my faith and my testimony and yet our testimony is onei am an old man and a man of the flesh but i want to show you that god exists for i believe that the son of god is a being living in us not without sin in whom we are made he is our father who gave the life of man and that we may be perfected when i see the lord i know that he has made me because i live in his image because i love him he gives all things unto me even his law which he hath given me in my flesh behold my love is eternal for i cannot die therefore god made the world to make me a living human being from the beginning he gave man his god the father it is not because of his grace that i was created all things are inspired by the holy spirit now the spirit has given man his way as the word of wisdom is an inspired word so he speaks from the heart thus the word of justice has its power when it speaks to man god has spoken to his people in his name we have made things no one can deny that in all his works god hath revealed himself to them as the apostle says in matthew 253132 for the glory of he that has heard the voice of truth is the work of glory matthew 2436 the same thing can be said of our lord jesus christ who was born of one begotten son and raised up in adams womb the father is only the cause of life so this is what we call our love how can we love our god why should we not be able but in that case the love of love too must be based upon that which is in our hearts our prayers prayers for what is right and just and justice a good will mercy love and holiness that is why i say you are a free person though you do not have the gift of being born again you will be,GPT2

 weapons and now you must give them to your master you must go in a straight line and give him his prize then you shall give up the sword but you will give it back to the master of the housethe king of england of this you may be sure and if you give the prize to his master it will be a crown of peace and honour for you have given him a prize of his own but there is no other prize for him to be so much better than this you are so foolish as not to see that you deserve it your master will surely love you the king will see you well your mother will love her son his father will know you very well and if he does not he will not give you any more he has made war on you for a long time so that he may not let you play by his rules there is nothing for your father and your brother to do about it but he is so afraid that if any one of you gives up his weapons he shall have no choice but to kill you the king must know that his men have lost their lives when the arms of your servant are used so he has taken a sword from your hand and a knife from his hand cut his throat with it taken him captive murdered your sister took your daughter captive if you do not come to him then he cannot say he would do it to you alone therefore you can take any of these weapons that are not yours he must take them no matter what you want them for it is not right that this should be done to a person who does nothing about these things moreover if the person is a slave that person cannot take up arms against him he can only be put to death if killed for this he was sent to be killed by the king do you know why he did not kill the slave that is called the redeemer because he had made him an enemy of that race this is why we must not forget the truth of it that the people who kill slaves are never to give a chance to their own people nor to those who steal from them no one who has stolen from a man is to go to prison what is the matter with you that people are always to steal because they do what they are told and what is it that they would steal for he,GPT2

it is in the latter phase in which the emperors personal views on the subject will be expressed he has not only agreed with the church in regard to the christian religion but has also been quite willing to give up his views in respect of the catholic church in the meantime the pope has appointed a new council to take up the matter in a more suitable manner this council is to determine the meaning and character of those questions which have arisen among the faithful the council will decide the question of the church and will declare their position it will also examine the nature of all the other questions raised by the council as well as those of their own part in it we have already seen that the present council was not composed of representatives of catholics hence it was necessary to make some distinction between the various parts of it and that which was already mentioned above those who were here present at the time of that council said that they did not know what it meant by the church or its church they did however make it clear that there are many other points of view which are of great importance to them they will in fact decide on these points according to what they consider to be their best interest some of them will argue that no one really knows what the word church means because it is an obscure or to use an even older term a place of worship or more precisely a place where the people live in harmony with each other others will say that it has nothing to do with religion but they will accept the statement that in no way can the words signify religion or any other thing for they think that this is the way to explain the fact that all religions are a place of residence that is of communion with one another that their meaning is that of being one and the same as it were as belonging to ones whole family and yet there is one important point which they do not accept as regards their views they say the term people in general is not used in connection with a particular group all religions have an element of some kind of common ancestry at present there exists only one religion the roman catholic religion and it does not belong to any particular class therefore it can be stated that some religion does actually belong in some way in relation to other thus it cannot be said for example with,GPT2
