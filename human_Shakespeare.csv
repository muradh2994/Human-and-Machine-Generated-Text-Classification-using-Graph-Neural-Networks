"ACT I SCENE I. London. The palace. Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others So shaken as we are, so wan with care, Find we a time for frighted peace to pant, And breathe short-winded accents of new broils To be commenced in strands afar remote. No more the thirsty entrance of this soil Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood, Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields, Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes, Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven, All of one nature, of one substance bred, Did lately meet in the intestine shock And furious close of civil butchery Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks, March all one way and be no more opposed Against acquaintance, kindred and allies: The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife, No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends, As far as to the sepulchre of Christ, Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross We are impressed and engaged to fight, Forthwith a power of English shall we levy, Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb To chase these pagans in those holy fields Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd For our advantage on the bitter cross. But this our purpose now is twelve month old, And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go: Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland, What yesternight our council did decree In forwarding this dear expedience. My liege, this haste was hot in question, And many limits of the charge set down But yesternight: when all athwart there came A post from Wales loaden with heavy news, Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer, Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight Against the irregular and wild Glendower, Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken, A thousand of his people butchered, Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse, Such beastly shameless transformation, By those Welshwomen done as may not be Without much shame retold or spoken of. It seems then that the tidings of this broil",Human
"Brake off our business for the Holy Land. This match'd with other did, my gracious lord, For more uneven and unwelcome news Came from the north and thus it did import: On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there, Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald, That ever-valiant and approved Scot, At Holmedon met, Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour, As by discharge of their artillery, And shape of likelihood, the news was told, For he that brought them, in the very heat And pride of their contention did take horse, Uncertain of the issue any way. Here is a dear, a true industrious friend, Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse. Stain'd with the variation of each soil Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours, And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news. The Earl of Douglas is discomfited: Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights, Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol, Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith: And is not this an honourable spoil? A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not? In faith, It is a conquest for a prince to boast of. Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin In envy that my Lord Northumberland Should be the father to so blest a son, A son who is the theme of honour's tongue, Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant, Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride: Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him, See riot and dishonour stain the brow Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged In cradle-clothes our children where they lay, And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet! Then would I have his Harry, and he mine. But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz, Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners, Which he in this adventure hath surprised, To his own use he keeps, and sends me word, I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife. This is his uncle's teaching, this is Worcester, Malevolent to you in all aspects,",Human
"Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up The crest of youth against your dignity. But I have sent for him to answer this, And for this cause awhile we must neglect Our holy purpose to Jerusalem. Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords: But come yourself with speed to us again, For more is to be said and to be done Than out of anger can be uttered. I will, my liege. Exeunt SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's. Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad? Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day. Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And, I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace thou wilt have none,-- What, none? No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to prologue to an egg and butter. Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly. Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon, and let men say we be men of good government, being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal. Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is, by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in,'",Human
"now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows. By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench? As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance? How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin? Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern? Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft. Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part? No, I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there. Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch, and where it would not, I have used my credit. Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief. No, thou shalt. Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge. Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman. Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell you. For obtaining of suits? Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear. Or an old lion, or a lover's lute. Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe. What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor-ditch? Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of the council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and yet he talked wisely, and in the street too. Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the streets, and no man regards it. O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon",Human
"me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain: I'll be damned for never a king's son in Christendom. Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack? 'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad, I'll make one, an I do not, call me villain and baffle me. I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying to purse-taking. Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal, 'tis no sin for a man to labour in his vocation. Enter POINS Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to a true man. Good morrow, Ned. Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse? what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg? Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs: he will give the devil his due. Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil. Else he had been damned for cozening the devil. But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards for you all, you have horses for yourselves: Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns, if you will not, tarry at home and be hanged. Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not, I'll hang you for going. You will, chops? Hal, wilt thou make one? Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith. There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings. Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.",Human
"Why, that's well said. Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home. By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king. I care not. Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone: I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go. Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may move and what he hears may be believed, that the true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false thief, for the poor abuses of the time want countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap. Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer! Exit Falstaff Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid: yourself and I will not be there, and when they have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head off from my shoulders. How shall we part with them in setting forth? Why, we will set forth before or after them, and appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them. Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits and by every other appointment, to be ourselves. Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them in the wood, our vizards we will change after we leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments. Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us. Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever turned back, and for the third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at least, he fought with, what wards, what blows, what extremities he endured, and in the reproof of this lies the jest. Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap, there I'll sup. Farewell. Farewell, my lord. Exit Poins",Human
"I know you all, and will awhile uphold The unyoked humour of your idleness: Yet herein will I imitate the sun, Who doth permit the base contagious clouds To smother up his beauty from the world, That, when he please again to be himself, Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at, By breaking through the foul and ugly mists Of vapours that did seem to strangle him. If all the year were playing holidays, To sport would be as tedious as to work, But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come, And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents. So, when this loose behavior I throw off And pay the debt I never promised, By how much better than my word I am, By so much shall I falsify men's hopes, And like bright metal on a sullen ground, My reformation, glittering o'er my fault, Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes Than that which hath no foil to set it off. I'll so offend, to make offence a skill, Redeeming time when men think least I will. Exit SCENE III. London. The palace. Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others My blood hath been too cold and temperate, Unapt to stir at these indignities, And you have found me, for accordingly You tread upon my patience: but be sure I will from henceforth rather be myself, Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition, Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down, And therefore lost that title of respect Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud. Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves The scourge of greatness to be used on it, And that same greatness too which our own hands Have holp to make so portly. My lord.-- Worcester, get thee gone, for I do see Danger and disobedience in thine eye: O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory, And majesty might never yet endure The moody frontier of a servant brow. You have good leave to leave us: when we need Your use and counsel, we shall send for you. Exit Worcester You were about to speak. To North",Human
"Yea, my good lord. Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded, Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took, Were, as he says, not with such strength denied As is deliver'd to your majesty: Either envy, therefore, or misprison Is guilty of this fault and not my son. My liege, I did deny no prisoners. But I remember, when the fight was done, When I was dry with rage and extreme toil, Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword, Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd, Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reap'd Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home, He was perfumed like a milliner, And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held A pouncet-box, which ever and anon He gave his nose and took't away again, Who therewith angry, when it next came there, Took it in snuff, and still he smiled and talk'd, And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by, He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly, To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse Betwixt the wind and his nobility. With many holiday and lady terms He question'd me, amongst the rest, demanded My prisoners in your majesty's behalf. I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold, To be so pester'd with a popinjay, Out of my grief and my impatience, Answer'd neglectingly I know not what, He should or he should not, for he made me mad To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!-- And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth Was parmaceti for an inward bruise, And that it was great pity, so it was, This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd Out of the bowels of the harmless earth, Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd So cowardly, and but for these vile guns, He would himself have been a soldier. This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord, I answer'd indirectly, as I said, And I beseech you, let not his report Come current for an accusation Betwixt my love and your high majesty. The circumstance consider'd, good my lord, Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said",Human
"To such a person and in such a place, At such a time, with all the rest retold, May reasonably die and never rise To do him wrong or any way impeach What then he said, so he unsay it now. Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners, But with proviso and exception, That we at our own charge shall ransom straight His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer, Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd The lives of those that he did lead to fight Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower, Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then, Be emptied to redeem a traitor home? Shall we but treason? and indent with fears, When they have lost and forfeited themselves? No, on the barren mountains let him starve, For I shall never hold that man my friend Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost To ransom home revolted Mortimer. Revolted Mortimer! He never did fall off, my sovereign liege, But by the chance of war, to prove that true Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds, Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank, In single opposition, hand to hand, He did confound the best part of an hour In changing hardiment with great Glendower: Three times they breathed and three times did they drink, Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood, Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks, Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds, And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank, Bloodstained with these valiant combatants. Never did base and rotten policy Colour her working with such deadly wounds, Nor could the noble Mortimer Receive so many, and all willingly: Then let not him be slander'd with revolt. Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him, He never did encounter with Glendower: I tell thee, He durst as well have met the devil alone As Owen Glendower for an enemy. Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer: Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,",Human
"Or you shall hear in such a kind from me As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland, We licence your departure with your son. Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it. Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train An if the devil come and roar for them, I will not send them: I will after straight And tell him so, for I will ease my heart, Albeit I make a hazard of my head. What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile: Here comes your uncle. Re-enter WORCESTER Speak of Mortimer! 'Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul Want mercy, if I do not join with him: Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins, And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust, But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer As high in the air as this unthankful king, As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke. Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad. Who struck this heat up after I was gone? He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners, And when I urged the ransom once again Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale, And on my face he turn'd an eye of death, Trembling even at the name of Mortimer. I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd By Richard that dead is the next of blood? He was, I heard the proclamation: And then it was when the unhappy king, --Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth Upon his Irish expedition, From whence he intercepted did return To be deposed and shortly murdered. And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth Live scandalized and foully spoken of. But soft, I pray you, did King Richard then Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer Heir to the crown? He did, myself did hear it. Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king, That wished him on the barren mountains starve. But shall it be that you, that set the crown Upon the head of this forgetful man And for his sake wear the detested blot Of murderous subornation, shall it be, That you a world of curses undergo, Being the agents, or base second means, The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?",Human
"O, pardon me that I descend so low, To show the line and the predicament Wherein you range under this subtle king, Shall it for shame be spoken in these days, Or fill up chronicles in time to come, That men of your nobility and power Did gage them both in an unjust behalf, As both of you--God pardon it!--have done, To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose, An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke? And shall it in more shame be further spoken, That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off By him for whom these shames ye underwent? No, yet time serves wherein you may redeem Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves Into the good thoughts of the world again, Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt Of this proud king, who studies day and night To answer all the debt he owes to you Even with the bloody payment of your deaths: Therefore, I say-- Peace, cousin, say no more: And now I will unclasp a secret book, And to your quick-conceiving discontents I'll read you matter deep and dangerous, As full of peril and adventurous spirit As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud On the unsteadfast footing of a spear. If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim: Send danger from the east unto the west, So honour cross it from the north to south, And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs To rouse a lion than to start a hare! Imagination of some great exploit Drives him beyond the bounds of patience. By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap, To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon, Or dive into the bottom of the deep, Where fathom-line could never touch the ground, And pluck up drowned honour by the locks, So he that doth redeem her thence might wear Without corrival, all her dignities: But out upon this half-faced fellowship! He apprehends a world of figures here, But not the form of what he should attend. Good cousin, give me audience for a while. I cry you mercy. Those same noble Scots That are your prisoners,-- I'll keep them all,",Human
"By God, he shall not have a Scot of them, No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not: I'll keep them, by this hand. You start away And lend no ear unto my purposes. Those prisoners you shall keep. Nay, I will, that's flat: He said he would not ransom Mortimer, Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer, But I will find him when he lies asleep, And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!' Nay, I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him To keep his anger still in motion. Hear you, cousin, a word. All studies here I solemnly defy, Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke: And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales, But that I think his father loves him not And would be glad he met with some mischance, I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale. Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you When you are better temper'd to attend. Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool Art thou to break into this woman's mood, Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own! Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods, Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke. In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?-- A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire, 'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept, His uncle York, where I first bow'd my knee Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,-- 'Sblood!-- When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh. At Berkley castle. You say true: Why, what a candy deal of courtesy This fawning greyhound then did proffer me! Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,' And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin,' O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me! Good uncle, tell your tale, I have done. Nay, if you have not, to it again, We will stay your leisure. I have done, i' faith. Then once more to your Scottish prisoners. Deliver them up without their ransom straight,",Human
"And make the Douglas' son your only mean For powers in Scotland, which, for divers reasons Which I shall send you written, be assured, Will easily be granted. You, my lord, To Northumberland Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd, Shall secretly into the bosom creep Of that same noble prelate, well beloved, The archbishop. Of York, is it not? True, who bears hard His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop. I speak not this in estimation, As what I think might be, but what I know Is ruminated, plotted and set down, And only stays but to behold the face Of that occasion that shall bring it on. I smell it: upon my life, it will do well. Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip. Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot, And then the power of Scotland and of York, To join with Mortimer, ha? And so they shall. In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd. And 'tis no little reason bids us speed, To save our heads by raising of a head, For, bear ourselves as even as we can, The king will always think him in our debt, And think we think ourselves unsatisfied, Till he hath found a time to pay us home: And see already how he doth begin To make us strangers to his looks of love. He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him. Cousin, farewell: no further go in this Than I by letters shall direct your course. When time is ripe, which will be suddenly, I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer, Where you and Douglas and our powers at once, As I will fashion it, shall happily meet, To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms, Which now we hold at much uncertainty.

It holds current that I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his company last night at supper, a kind of auditor, one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what. They are up already, and call for eggs and butter, they will away presently. Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas' clerks, I'll give thee this neck. No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the hangman, for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas as truly as a man of falsehood may. What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang, I'll make a fat pair of gallows, for if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are content to do the profession some grace, that would, if matters should be looked into, for their own credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers, none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms, but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds, I lie, for they pray continually to their saint, the commonwealth, or rather, not pray to her, but prey on her, for they ride up and down on her and make her their boots. What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold out water in foul way? She will, she will, justice hath liquored her.

I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse, good king's son. Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler? Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this.

'The purpose you undertake is dangerous,'--why, that's certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink, but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The purpose you undertake is dangerous, the friends you have named uncertain, the time itself unsorted, and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and you lie.  What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid, our friends true and constant: a good plot, good friends, and full of expectation, an excellent plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan. Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower? is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month? and are they not some of them set forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay open all our proceedings.

Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks, And given my treasures and my rights of thee To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy? In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd, And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars, Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed, Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents, Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets, Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin, Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain, And all the currents of a heady fight. Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep, That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream, And in thy face strange motions have appear'd, Such as we see when men restrain their breath On some great sudden hest.

The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?

I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff, so, if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up! I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another. Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good conscience.

"First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry Hath follow'd certain men unto this house. What men? One of them is well known, my gracious lord, A gross fat man. As fat as butter. The man, I do assure you, is not here, For I myself at this time have employ'd him. And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time, Send him to answer thee, or any man, For any thing he shall be charged withal: And so let me entreat you leave the house. I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks. It may be so: if he have robb'd these men, He shall be answerable, and so farewell. Good night, my noble lord.

"These promises are fair, the parties sure, And our induction full of prosperous hope. Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower, Will you sit down? And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it! I have forgot the map. No, here it is. Sit, cousin Percy, sit, good cousin Hotspur, For by that name as oft as Lancaster Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven. And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of. I cannot blame him: at my nativity The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, Of burning cressets, and at my birth The frame and huge foundation of the earth Shaked like a coward. Why, so it would have done at the same season, if your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself had never been born. I say the earth did shake when I was born. And I say the earth was not of my mind, If you suppose as fearing you it shook. The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble. O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire, And not in fear of your nativity. Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth In strange eruptions, oft the teeming earth Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd By the imprisoning of unruly wind Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving, Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth Our grandam earth, having this distemperature, In passion shook. Cousin, of many men I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave To tell you once again that at my birth The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields. These signs have mark'd me extraordinary, And all the courses of my life do show I am not in the roll of common men. Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales, Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me? And bring him out that is but woman's son Can trace me in the tedious ways of art And hold me pace in deep experiments.",Human
"I think there's no man speaks better Welsh. I'll to dinner. Peace, cousin Percy, you will make him mad. I can call spirits from the vasty deep. Why, so can I, or so can any man, But will they come when you do call for them? Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command The devil. And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil. If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither, And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence. O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil! Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat. Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head Against my power, thrice from the banks of Wye And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him Bootless home and weather-beaten back. Home without boots, and in foul weather too! How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name? Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right According to our threefold order ta'en? The archdeacon hath divided it Into three limits very equally: England, from Trent and Severn hitherto, By south and east is to my part assign'd: All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore, And all the fertile land within that bound, To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you The remnant northward, lying off from Trent. And our indentures tripartite are drawn, Which being sealed interchangeably, A business that this night may execute, To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth To meet your father and the Scottish power, As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury. My father Glendower is not ready yet, Not shall we need his help these fourteen days. Within that space you may have drawn together Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen. A shorter time shall send me to you, lords: And in my conduct shall your ladies come, From whom you now must steal and take no leave, For there will be a world of water shed Upon the parting of your wives and you. Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here, In quantity equals not one of yours: See how this river comes me cranking in, And cuts me from the best of all my land",Human
"A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out. I'll have the current in this place damm'd up, And here the smug and silver Trent shall run In a new channel, fair and evenly, It shall not wind with such a deep indent, To rob me of so rich a bottom here. Not wind? it shall, it must, you see it doth. Yea, but Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up With like advantage on the other side, Gelding the opposed continent as much As on the other side it takes from you. Yea, but a little charge will trench him here And on this north side win this cape of land, And then he runs straight and even. I'll have it so: a little charge will do it. I'll not have it alter'd. Will not you? No, nor you shall not. Who shall say me nay? Why, that will I. Let me not understand you, then, speak it in Welsh. I can speak English, lord, as well as you, For I was train'd up in the English court, Where, being but young, I framed to the harp Many an English ditty lovely well And gave the tongue a helpful ornament, A virtue that was never seen in you. Marry, And I am glad of it with all my heart: I had rather be a kitten and cry mew Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers, I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd, Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree, And that would set my teeth nothing on edge, Nothing so much as mincing poetry: 'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag. Come, you shall have Trent turn'd. I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land To any well-deserving friend, But in the way of bargain, mark ye me, I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair. Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone? The moon shines fair, you may away by night: I'll haste the writer and withal Break with your wives of your departure hence: I am afraid my daughter will run mad, So much she doteth on her Mortimer.

"I cannot choose: sometime he angers me With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant, Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies, And of a dragon and a finless fish, A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven, A couching lion and a ramping cat, And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff As puts me from my faith. I tell you what, He held me last night at least nine hours In reckoning up the several devils' names That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,' But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious As a tired horse, a railing wife, Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far, Than feed on cates and have him talk to me In any summer-house in Christendom. In faith, he is a worthy gentleman, Exceedingly well read, and profited In strange concealments, valiant as a lion And as wondrous affable and as bountiful As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin? He holds your temper in a high respect And curbs himself even of his natural scope When you come 'cross his humour, faith, he does: I warrant you, that man is not alive Might so have tempted him as you have done, Without the taste of danger and reproof: But do not use it oft, let me entreat you. In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame, And since your coming hither have done enough To put him quite beside his patience. You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault: Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,-- And that's the dearest grace it renders you,-- Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage, Defect of manners, want of government, Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain: The least of which haunting a nobleman Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain Upon the beauty of all parts besides, Beguiling them of commendation. Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed! Here come our wives, and let us take our leave. Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies This is the deadly spite that angers me, My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.

"Shall follow in your conduct speedily. Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same She is desperate here, a peevish self-wind harlotry, one that no persuasion can do good upon. The lady speaks in Welsh I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens I am too perfect in, and, but for shame, In such a parley should I answer thee. The lady speaks again in Welsh I understand thy kisses and thou mine, And that's a feeling disputation: But I will never be a truant, love, Till I have learned thy language, for thy tongue Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd, Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower, With ravishing division, to her lute. Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad. The lady speaks again in Welsh O, I am ignorance itself in this! She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down And rest your gentle head upon her lap, And she will sing the song that pleaseth you And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep. Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness, Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep As is the difference betwixt day and night The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team Begins his golden progress in the east. With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing: By that time will our book, I think, be drawn Do so, And those musicians that shall play to you Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence, And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend. Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come, quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap. Go, ye giddy goose. The music plays Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh, And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous. By'r lady, he is a good musician. Then should you be nothing but musical for you are altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief, and hear the lady sing in Welsh. I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish. Wouldst thou have thy head broken? No. Then be still. Neither,'tis a woman's fault.",Human

'Not you, in good sooth,' and 'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and 'as sure as day,' And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths, As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury. Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art, A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,' And such protest of pepper-gingerbread, To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens. Come, sing. I will not sing.

Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others Lords, give us leave, the Prince of Wales and I Must have some private conference, but be near at hand, For we shall presently have need of you. Exeunt Lords I know not whether God will have it so, For some displeasing service I have done, That, in his secret doom, out of my blood He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me, But thou dost in thy passages of life Make me believe that thou art only mark'd For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else, Could such inordinate and low desires, Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts, Such barren pleasures, rude society, As thou art match'd withal and grafted to, Accompany the greatness of thy blood And hold their level with thy princely heart? So please your majesty, I would I could",Human
"Quit all offences with as clear excuse As well as I am doubtless I can purge Myself of many I am charged withal: Yet such extenuation let me beg, As, in reproof of many tales devised, which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear, By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers, I may, for some things true, wherein my youth Hath faulty wander'd and irregular, Find pardon on my true submission. God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry, At thy affections, which do hold a wing Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors. Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost. Which by thy younger brother is supplied, And art almost an alien to the hearts Of all the court and princes of my blood: The hope and expectation of thy time Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man Prophetically doth forethink thy fall. Had I so lavish of my presence been, So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men, So stale and cheap to vulgar company, Opinion, that did help me to the crown, Had still kept loyal to possession And left me in reputeless banishment, A fellow of no mark nor likelihood. By being seldom seen, I could not stir But like a comet I was wonder'd at, That men would tell their children 'This is he,' Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?' And then I stole all courtesy from heaven, And dress'd myself in such humility That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts, Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths, Even in the presence of the crowned king. Thus did I keep my person fresh and new, My presence, like a robe pontifical, Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state, Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast And won by rareness such solemnity. The skipping king, he ambled up and down With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits, Soon kindled and soon burnt, carded his state, Mingled his royalty with capering fools, Had his great name profaned with their scorns And gave his countenance, against his name, To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push Of every beardless vain comparative, Grew a companion to the common streets,",Human

So when he had occasion to be seen, He was but as the cuckoo is in June, Heard, not regarded, seen, but with such eyes As, sick and blunted with community, Afford no extraordinary gaze, Such as is bent on sun-like majesty When it shines seldom in admiring eyes, But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down, Slept in his face and render'd such aspect As cloudy men use to their adversaries, Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full. And in that very line, Harry, standest thou, For thou has lost thy princely privilege With vile participation: not an eye But is a-weary of thy common sight, Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more, Which now doth that I would not have it do, Make blind itself with foolish tenderness. I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord, Be more myself. For all the world As thou art to this hour was Richard then When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh, And even as I was then is Percy now. Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot, He hath more worthy interest to the state Than thou the shadow of succession, For of no right, nor colour like to right, He doth fill fields with harness in the realm, Turns head against the lion's armed jaws, And, being no more in debt to years than thou, Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on To bloody battles and to bruising arms. What never-dying honour hath he got Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds, Whose hot incursions and great name in arms Holds from all soldiers chief majority And military title capital Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ: Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes, This infant warrior, in his enterprises Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once, Enlarged him and made a friend of him, To fill the mouth of deep defiance up And shake the peace and safety of our throne.",Human

Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes, Which art my near'st and dearest enemy? Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear, Base inclination and the start of spleen To fight against me under Percy's pay, To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns, To show how much thou art degenerate. Do not think so, you shall not find it so: And God forgive them that so much have sway'd Your majesty's good thoughts away from me! I will redeem all this on Percy's head And in the closing of some glorious day Be bold to tell you that I am your son, When I will wear a garment all of blood And stain my favours in a bloody mask, Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it: And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights, That this same child of honour and renown, This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight, And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet. For every honour sitting on his helm, Would they were multitudes, and on my head My shames redoubled! for the time will come, That I shall make this northern youth exchange His glorious deeds for my indignities. Percy is but my factor, good my lord, To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf, And I will call him to so strict account, That he shall render every glory up, Yea, even the slightest worship of his time, Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart. This, in the name of God, I promise here: The which if He be pleased I shall perform, I do beseech your majesty may salve The long-grown wounds of my intemperance: If not, the end of life cancels all bands, And I will die a hundred thousand deaths Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.

Thou art the king of honour: No man so potent breathes upon the ground But I will beard him. Do so, and 'tis well. Enter a Messenger with letters What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you. These letters come from your father. Letters from him! why comes he not himself? He cannot come, my lord, he is grievous sick. 'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?",Human
"Under whose government come they along? His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord. I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed? He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth, And at the time of my departure thence He was much fear'd by his physicians. I would the state of time had first been whole Ere he by sickness had been visited: His health was never better worth than now. Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect The very life-blood of our enterprise, 'Tis catching hither, even to our camp. He writes me here, that inward sickness-- And that his friends by deputation could not So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet To lay so dangerous and dear a trust On any soul removed but on his own. Yet doth he give us bold advertisement, That with our small conjunction we should on, To see how fortune is disposed to us, For, as he writes, there is no quailing now. Because the king is certainly possess'd Of all our purposes. What say you to it? Your father's sickness is a maim to us. A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off: And yet, in faith, it is not, his present want Seems more than we shall find it: were it good To set the exact wealth of all our states All at one cast? to set so rich a main On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour? It were not good, for therein should we read The very bottom and the soul of hope, The very list, the very utmost bound Of all our fortunes. 'Faith, and so we should, Where now remains a sweet reversion: We may boldly spend upon the hope of what Is to come in: A comfort of retirement lives in this. A rendezvous, a home to fly unto. If that the devil and mischance look big Upon the maidenhead of our affairs. But yet I would your father had been here. The quality and hair of our attempt Brooks no division: it will be thought By some, that know not why he is away, That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence: And think how such an apprehension May turn the tide of fearful faction",Human
"And breed a kind of question in our cause, For well you know we of the offering side Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement, And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence The eye of reason may pry in upon us: This absence of your father's draws a curtain, That shows the ignorant a kind of fear Before not dreamt of. You strain too far. I rather of his absence make this use: It lends a lustre and more great opinion, A larger dare to our great enterprise, Than if the earl were here, for men must think, If we without his help can make a head To push against a kingdom, with his help We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down. Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole. As heart can think: there is not such a word Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear. Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul. Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord. The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong, Is marching hitherwards, with him Prince John. No harm: what more? And further, I have learn'd, The king himself in person is set forth, Or hitherwards intended speedily, With strong and mighty preparation. He shall be welcome too. Where is his son, The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales, And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside, And bid it pass? All furnish'd, all in arms, All plumed like estridges that with the wind Baited like eagles having lately bathed, Glittering in golden coats, like images, As full of spirit as the month of May, And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer, Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls. I saw young Harry, with his beaver on, His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury, And vaulted with such ease into his seat, As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds, To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus And witch the world with noble horsemanship. No more, no more: worse than the sun in March, This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come: They come like sacrifices in their trim,",Human
"And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war All hot and bleeding will we offer them: The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse, Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales: Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse, Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse. O that Glendower were come! There is more news: I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along, He cannot draw his power this fourteen days. That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet. Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound. What may the king's whole battle reach unto? To thirty thousand. Forty let it be: My father and Glendower being both away, The powers of us may serve so great a day Come, let us take a muster speedily: Doomsday is near, die all, die merrily. Talk not of dying: I am out of fear Of death or death's hand for this one-half year. Exeunt SCENE II. A public road near Coventry. Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry, fill me a bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through, we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight. Will you give me money, captain? Lay out, lay out. This bottle makes an angel. An if it do, take it for thy labour, and if it make twenty, take them all, I'll answer the coinage. Bid my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end. I will, captain: farewell. Exit If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably. I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons, inquire me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked twice on the banns, such a commodity of warm slaves, as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum, such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no",Human
"bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out their services, and now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his sores, and such as indeed were never soldiers, but discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services, that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my company, and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like an herald's coat without sleeves, and the shirt, to say the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all one, they'll find linen enough on every hedge. Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt! What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been at Shrewsbury. Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were there, and you too, but my powers are there already. The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must away all night. Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream. I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose fellows are these that come after? Mine, Hal, mine. I did never see such pitiful rascals. Tut, tut, good enough to toss, food for powder, food for powder, they'll fill a pit as well as better: tush, man, mortal men, mortal men. Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor and bare, too beggarly.",Human
"'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had that, and for their bareness, I am sure they never learned that of me. No I'll be sworn, unless you call three fingers on the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is already in the field. What, is the king encamped? He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long. Well, To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest. Exeunt SCENE III. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury. Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, and VERNON We'll fight with him to-night. It may not be. You give him then the advantage. Not a whit. Why say you so? looks he not for supply? So do we. His is certain, ours is doubtful. Good cousin, be advised, stir not tonight. Do not, my lord. You do not counsel well: You speak it out of fear and cold heart. Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life, And I dare well maintain it with my life, If well-respected honour bid me on, I hold as little counsel with weak fear As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives: Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle Which of us fears. Yea, or to-night. Content. To-night, say I. Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much, Being men of such great leading as you are, That you foresee not what impediments Drag back our expedition: certain horse Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up: Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today, And now their pride and mettle is asleep, Their courage with hard labour tame and dull, That not a horse is half the half of himself. So are the horses of the enemy In general, journey-bated and brought low: The better part of ours are full of rest. The number of the king exceedeth ours: For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in. The trumpet sounds a parley",Human
"Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT I come with gracious offers from the king, if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect. Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt, and would to God You were of our determination! Some of us love you well, and even those some Envy your great deservings and good name, Because you are not of our quality, But stand against us like an enemy. And God defend but still I should stand so, So long as out of limit and true rule You stand against anointed majesty. But to my charge. The king hath sent to know The nature of your griefs, and whereupon You conjure from the breast of civil peace Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land Audacious cruelty. If that the king Have any way your good deserts forgot, Which he confesseth to be manifold, He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed You shall have your desires with interest And pardon absolute for yourself and these Herein misled by your suggestion. The king is kind, and well we know the king Knows at what time to promise, when to pay. My father and my uncle and myself Did give him that same royalty he wears, And when he was not six and twenty strong, Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low, A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home, My father gave him welcome to the shore, And when he heard him swear and vow to God He came but to be Duke of Lancaster, To sue his livery and beg his peace, With tears of innocency and terms of zeal, My father, in kind heart and pity moved, Swore him assistance and perform'd it too. Now when the lords and barons of the realm Perceived Northumberland did lean to him, The more and less came in with cap and knee, Met him in boroughs, cities, villages, Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes, Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths, Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him Even at the heels in golden multitudes. He presently, as greatness knows itself, Steps me a little higher than his vow Made to my father, while his blood was poor, Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh, And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform",Human
"Some certain edicts and some strait decrees That lie too heavy on the commonwealth, Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep Over his country's wrongs, and by this face, This seeming brow of justice, did he win The hearts of all that he did angle for, Proceeded further, cut me off the heads Of all the favourites that the absent king In deputation left behind him here, When he was personal in the Irish war. Tut, I came not to hear this. Then to the point. In short time after, he deposed the king, Soon after that, deprived him of his life, And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state: To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March, Who is, if every owner were well placed, Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales, There without ransom to lie forfeited, Disgraced me in my happy victories, Sought to entrap me by intelligence, Rated mine uncle from the council-board, In rage dismiss'd my father from the court, Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong, And in conclusion drove us to seek out This head of safety, and withal to pry Into his title, the which we find Too indirect for long continuance. Shall I return this answer to the king? Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile. Go to the king, and let there be impawn'd Some surety for a safe return again, And in the morning early shall my uncle Bring him our purposes: and so farewell. I would you would accept of grace and love. And may be so we shall. Pray God you do. Exeunt SCENE IV. York. The ARCHBISHOP'S palace. Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL Hie, good Sir Michael, bear this sealed brief With winged haste to the lord marshal, This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest To whom they are directed. If you knew How much they do to import, you would make haste. My good lord, I guess their tenor. Like enough you do. To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men",Human
"Must bide the touch, for, sir, at Shrewsbury, As I am truly given to understand, The king with mighty and quick-raised power Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael, What with the sickness of Northumberland, Whose power was in the first proportion, And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence, Who with them was a rated sinew too And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies, I fear the power of Percy is too weak To wage an instant trial with the king. Why, my good lord, you need not fear, There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer. No, Mortimer is not there. But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy, And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen. And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn The special head of all the land together: The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt, And moe corrivals and dear men Of estimation and command in arms. Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed. I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear, And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed: For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king Dismiss his power, he means to visit us, For he hath heard of our confederacy, And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him: Therefore make haste. I must go write again To other friends, and so farewell, Sir Michael. Exeunt ACT V SCENE I. KING HENRY IV's camp near Shrewsbury. Enter KING HENRY, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of  LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and FALSTAFF How bloodily the sun begins to peer Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale At his distemperature. The southern wind Doth play the trumpet to his purposes, And by his hollow whistling in the leaves Foretells a tempest and a blustering day. Then with the losers let it sympathize, For nothing can seem foul to those that win. The trumpet sounds Enter WORCESTER and VERNON How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well That you and I should meet upon such terms As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,",Human
"And made us doff our easy robes of peace, To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel: This is not well, my lord, this is not well. What say you to it? will you again unknit This curlish knot of all-abhorred war? And move in that obedient orb again Where you did give a fair and natural light, And be no more an exhaled meteor, A prodigy of fear and a portent Of broached mischief to the unborn times? Hear me, my liege: For mine own part, I could be well content To entertain the lag-end of my life With quiet hours, for I do protest, I have not sought the day of this dislike. You have not sought it! how comes it, then? Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it. Peace, chewet, peace! It pleased your majesty to turn your looks Of favour from myself and all our house, And yet I must remember you, my lord, We were the first and dearest of your friends. For you my staff of office did I break In Richard's time, and posted day and night to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand, When yet you were in place and in account Nothing so strong and fortunate as I. It was myself, my brother and his son, That brought you home and boldly did outdare The dangers of the time. You swore to us, And you did swear that oath at Doncaster, That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state, Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right, The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster: To this we swore our aid. But in short space It rain'd down fortune showering on your head, And such a flood of greatness fell on you, What with our help, what with the absent king, What with the injuries of a wanton time, The seeming sufferances that you had borne, And the contrarious winds that held the king So long in his unlucky Irish wars That all in England did repute him dead: And from this swarm of fair advantages You took occasion to be quickly woo'd To gripe the general sway into your hand, Forget your oath to us at Doncaster, And being fed by us you used us so As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird, Useth the sparrow, did oppress our nest,",Human
"Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk That even our love durst not come near your sight For fear of swallowing, but with nimble wing We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly Out of sight and raise this present head, Whereby we stand opposed by such means As you yourself have forged against yourself By unkind usage, dangerous countenance, And violation of all faith and troth Sworn to us in your younger enterprise. These things indeed you have articulate, Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches, To face the garment of rebellion With some fine colour that may please the eye Of fickle changelings and poor discontents, Which gape and rub the elbow at the news Of hurlyburly innovation: And never yet did insurrection want Such water-colours to impaint his cause, Nor moody beggars, starving for a time Of pellmell havoc and confusion. In both your armies there is many a soul Shall pay full dearly for this encounter, If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew, The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes, This present enterprise set off his head, I do not think a braver gentleman, More active-valiant or more valiant-young, More daring or more bold, is now alive To grace this latter age with noble deeds. For my part, I may speak it to my shame, I have a truant been to chivalry, And so I hear he doth account me too, Yet this before my father's majesty-- I am content that he shall take the odds Of his great name and estimation, And will, to save the blood on either side, Try fortune with him in a single fight. And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee, Albeit considerations infinite Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no, We love our people well, even those we love That are misled upon your cousin's part, And, will they take the offer of our grace, Both he and they and you, every man Shall be my friend again and I'll be his: So tell your cousin, and bring me word What he will do: but if he will not yield, Rebuke and dread correction wait on us",Human

What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter, honour pricks me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no. Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it? he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no. Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the living? no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so ends my catechism. Exit SCENE II. The rebel camp. Enter WORCESTER and VERNON O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard, The liberal and kind offer of the king. 'Twere best he did. Then are we all undone. It is not possible, it cannot be, The king should keep his word in loving us, He will suspect us still and find a time To punish this offence in other faults: Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes, For treason is but trusted like the fox, Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up, Will have a wild trick of his ancestors. Look how we can, or sad or merrily, Interpretation will misquote our looks,",Human

My nephew's trespass may be well forgot, it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood, And an adopted name of privilege, A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen: All his offences live upon my head And on his father's, we did train him on, And, his corruption being ta'en from us, We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all. Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know, In any case, the offer of the king. Deliver what you will, I'll say 'tis so. Here comes your cousin.

Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so. Marry, and shall, and very willingly. Exit There is no seeming mercy in the king. Did you beg any? God forbid!

O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads, And that no man might draw short breath today But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me, How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt? No, by my soul, I never in my life Did hear a challenge urged more modestly, Unless a brother should a brother dare To gentle exercise and proof of arms.

A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear: Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king? The king hath many marching in his coats.

Exit Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his willingly, let him make a carbonado of me.

Why, then I see A very valiant rebel of the name. I am the Prince of Wales, and think not, Percy, To share with me in glory any more: Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere, Nor can one England brook a double reign, Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales. Nor shall it, Harry, for the hour is come To end the one of us, and would to God Thy name in arms were now as great as mine! I'll make it greater ere I part from thee, And all the budding honours on thy crest I'll crop, to make a garland for my head. I can no longer brook thy vanities.",Human

Re-enter DOUGLAS, he fights with FALSTAFF,  who falls down as if he were dead, and exit DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth! I better brook the loss of brittle life Than those proud titles thou hast won of me, They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh: But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool, And time, that takes survey of all the world, Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy, But that the earthy and cold hand of death Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust And food for-- Dies For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart! Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk! When that this body did contain a spirit, A kingdom for it was too small a bound, But now two paces of the vilest earth Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead Bears not alive so stout a gentleman. If thou wert sensible of courtesy, I should not make so dear a show of zeal: But let my favours hide thy mangled face, And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself For doing these fair rites of tenderness. Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven! Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave, But not remember'd in thy epitaph! He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell! I could have better spared a better man: O, I should have a heavy miss of thee, If I were much in love with vanity!

The better part of valour is discretion, in the which better part I have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit. Therefore I'll make him sure, yea, and I'll swear I killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I? Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.

I prithee, speak, we will not trust our eyes Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st. No, that's certain, I am not a double man: but if I be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy: Throwing the body down if your father will do me any honour, so, if not, let him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either earl or duke, I can assure you. Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead. Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath, and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be believed, so, if not, let them that should reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it, 'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword. This is the strangest tale that ever I heard. This is the strangest fellow, brother John. Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back: For my part, if a lie may do thee grace, I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have. A retreat is sounded The trumpet sounds retreat, the day is ours.

King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long! England ne'er lost a king of so much worth. England ne'er had a king until his time. Virtue he had, deserving to command: His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams: His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings, His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire, More dazzled and drove back his enemies Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces. What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech: He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered. We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood? Henry is dead and never shall revive: Upon a wooden coffin we attend, And death's dishonourable victory We with our stately presence glorify, Like captives bound to a triumphant car. What! shall we curse the planets of mishap That plotted thus our glory's overthrow? Or shall we think the subtle-witted French Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him By magic verses have contrived his end? BISHOP He was a king bless'd of the King of kings. Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day So dreadful will not be as was his sight. The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought: The church's prayers made him so prosperous. The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd, His thread of life had not so soon decay'd: None do you like but an effeminate prince, Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.

"Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh, And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st Except it be to pray against thy foes. Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace: Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us: Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms: Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead. Posterity, await for wretched years, When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck, Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears, And none but women left to wail the dead. Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate: Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils, Combat with adverse planets in the heavens! A far more glorious star thy soul will make Than Julius Caesar or bright-- Enter a Messenger My honourable lords, health to you all! Sad tidings bring I to you out of France, Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture: Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans, Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost. What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse? Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns Will make him burst his lead and rise from death. Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up? If Henry were recall'd to life again, These news would cause him once more yield the ghost. How were they lost? what treachery was used? No treachery, but want of men and money. Amongst the soldiers this is muttered, That here you maintain several factions, And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought, You are disputing of your generals: One would have lingering wars with little cost, Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings, A third thinks, without expense at all, By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd. Awake, awake, English nobility! Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot: Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms, Of England's coat one half is cut away. Were our tears wanting to this funeral, These tidings would call forth their flowing tides. Me they concern, Regent I am of France. Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.

"Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance. France is revolted from the English quite, Except some petty towns of no import: The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims, The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd, Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part, The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side. The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him! O, whither shall we fly from this reproach? We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats. Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out. Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness? An army have I muster'd in my thoughts, Wherewith already France is overrun. Enter another Messenger My gracious lords, to add to your laments, Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse, I must inform you of a dismal fight Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French. BISHOP What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so? O, no, wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown: The circumstance I'll tell you more at large. The tenth of August last this dreadful lord, Retiring from the siege of Orleans, Having full scarce six thousand in his troop. By three and twenty thousand of the French Was round encompassed and set upon. No leisure had he to enrank his men, He wanted pikes to set before his archers, Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges They pitched in the ground confusedly, To keep the horsemen off from breaking in. More than three hours the fight continued, Where valiant Talbot above human thought Enacted wonders with his sword and lance: Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him, Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew: The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms, All the whole army stood agazed on him: His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain And rush'd into the bowels of the battle. Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up, If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward: He, being in the vaward, placed behind With purpose to relieve and follow them, Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke. Hence grew the general wreck and massacre, Enclosed were they with their enemies:",Human
"A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace, Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back, Whom all France with their chief assembled strength Durst not presume to look once in the face. Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself, For living idly here in pomp and ease, Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid, Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd. O no, he lives, but is took prisoner, And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford: Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise. His ransom there is none but I shall pay: I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne: His crown shall be the ransom of my friend, Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours. Farewell, my masters, to my task will I, Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make, To keep our great Saint George's feast withal: Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take, Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake. So you had need, for Orleans is besieged, The English army is grown weak and faint: The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply, And hardly keeps his men from mutiny, Since they, so few, watch such a multitude. Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn, Either to quell the Dauphin utterly, Or bring him in obedience to your yoke. I do remember it, and here take my leave, To go about my preparation. Exit I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can, To view the artillery and munition, And then I will proclaim young Henry king. Exit To Eltham will I, where the young king is, Being ordain'd his special governor, And for his safety there I'll best devise.

At pleasure here we lie near Orleans, Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts, Faintly besiege us one hour in a month. They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves: Either they must be dieted like mules And have their provender tied to their mouths Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice. Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here? Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear: Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury, And he may well in fretting spend his gall, Nor men nor money hath he to make war. Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them. Now for the honour of the forlorn French! Him I forgive my death that killeth me When he sees me go back one foot or fly. Exeunt Here alarum, they are beaten back by the English with great loss. Re-enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER Who ever saw the like? what men have I! Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled, But that they left me 'midst my enemies. Salisbury is a desperate homicide, He fighteth as one weary of his life. The other lords, like lions wanting food, Do rush upon us as their hungry prey. Froissart, a countryman of ours, records, England all Olivers and Rowlands bred, During the time Edward the Third did reign. More truly now may this be verified, For none but Samsons and Goliases It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten! Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose They had such courage and audacity? Let's leave this town, for they are hare-brain'd slaves, And hunger will enforce them to be more eager: Of old I know them, rather with their teeth The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege. I think, by some odd gimmors or device Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on, Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do. By my consent, we'll even let them alone. Be it so.

Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd: Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?",Human
"Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand: A holy maid hither with me I bring, Which by a vision sent to her from heaven Ordained is to raise this tedious siege And drive the English forth the bounds of France. The spirit of deep prophecy she hath, Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome: What's past and what's to come she can descry. Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words, For they are certain and unfallible. Go, call her in. Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS But first, to try her skill, Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place: Question her proudly, let thy looks be stern: By this means shall we sound what skill she hath. Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, with JOAN LA PUCELLE Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats? Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me? Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind, I know thee well, though never seen before. Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me: In private will I talk with thee apart. Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile. She takes upon her bravely at first dash. Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter, My wit untrain'd in any kind of art. Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased To shine on my contemptible estate: Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs, And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks, God's mother deigned to appear to me And in a vision full of majesty Will'd me to leave my base vocation And free my country from calamity: Her aid she promised and assured success: In complete glory she reveal'd herself, And, whereas I was black and swart before, With those clear rays which she infused on me That beauty am I bless'd with which you see. Ask me what question thou canst possible, And I will answer unpremeditated: My courage try by combat, if thou darest, And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex. Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate, If thou receive me for thy warlike mate. Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms: Only this proof I'll of thy valour make, In single combat thou shalt buckle with me, And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true,",Human
"Otherwise I renounce all confidence. I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword, Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side, The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's churchyard, Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth. Then come, o' God's name, I fear no woman. And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man. Here they fight, and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon And fightest with the sword of Deborah. Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak. Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me: Impatiently I burn with thy desire, My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued. Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so, Let me thy servant and not sovereign be: 'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus. I must not yield to any rites of love, For my profession's sacred from above: When I have chased all thy foes from hence, Then will I think upon a recompense. Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall. My lord, methinks, is very long in talk. Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock, Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech. Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean? He may mean more than we poor men do know: These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues. My lord, where are you? what devise you on? Shall we give over Orleans, or no? Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants! Fight till the last gasp, I will be your guard. What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out. Assign'd am I to be the English scourge. This night the siege assuredly I'll raise: Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days, Since I have entered into these wars. Glory is like a circle in the water, Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought. With Henry's death the English circle ends, Dispersed are the glories it included. Now am I like that proud insulting ship Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once. Was Mahomet inspired with a dove? Thou with an eagle art inspired then. Helen, the mother of great Constantine, Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee. Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,",Human

Open the gates, 'tis Gloucester that calls. [Within]  Who's there that knocks so imperiously? First Serving-Man	It is the noble Duke of Gloucester. [Within]  Whoe'er he be, you may not be let in. First Serving-Man	Villains, answer you so the lord protector? [Within]  The Lord protect him! so we answer him: We do no otherwise than we are will'd. Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine? There's none protector of the realm but I. Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize. Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms? Gloucester's men rush at the Tower Gates, and WOODVILE the Lieutenant speaks within What noise is this? what traitors have we here? Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear? Open the gates, here's Gloucester that would enter. Have patience, noble duke, I may not open, The Cardinal of Winchester forbids: From him I have express commandment That thou nor none of thine shall be let in. Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me? Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate, Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook? Thou art no friend to God or to the king: Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly. Serving-Men	Open the gates unto the lord protector, Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.

BISHOP I do, thou most usurping proditor, And not protector, of the king or realm.

"BISHOP Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot: This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain, To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt. I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back: Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth I'll use to carry thee out of this place. BISHOP Do what thou darest, I beard thee to thy face. What! am I dared and bearded to my face? Draw, men, for all this privileged place, Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard, I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly: Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat: In spite of pope or dignities of church, Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down. BISHOP Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope. Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope! Now beat them hence, why do you let them stay? Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array. Out, tawny coats! out, scarlet hypocrite!

Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs: Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king, Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use. BISHOP Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens, One that still motions war and never peace, O'ercharging your free purses with large fines, That seeks to overthrow religion, Because he is protector of the realm, And would have armour here out of the Tower, To crown himself king and suppress the prince. I will not answer thee with words, but blows. Here they skirmish again Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife But to make open proclamation: Come, officer, as loud as e'er thou canst, Cry. All manner of men assembled here in arms this day against God's peace and the king's, we charge and command you, in his highness' name, to repair to your several dwelling-places, and not to wear, handle, or use any sword, weapon, or dagger, henceforward, upon pain of death.

Father, I know, and oft have shot at them, Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim. Master-Gunner	But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me: Chief master-gunner am I of this town, Something I must do to procure me grace. The prince's espials have informed me How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd, Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars In yonder tower, to overpeer the city, And thence discover how with most advantage They may vex us with shot, or with assault. To intercept this inconvenience, A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed, And even these three days have I watch'd, If I could see them. Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer. If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word, And thou shalt find me at the governor's. Exit Father, I warrant you, take you no care, I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.

Or by what means got'st thou to be released? Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top. The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles, For him was I exchanged and ransomed. But with a baser man of arms by far Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:",Human
"Which I, disdaining, scorn'd, and craved death, Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd. In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired. But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart, Whom with my bare fists I would execute, If I now had him brought into my power. Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd. With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts. In open market-place produced they me, To be a public spectacle to all: Here, said they, is the terror of the French, The scarecrow that affrights our children so. Then broke I from the officers that led me, And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground, To hurl at the beholders of my shame: My grisly countenance made others fly, None durst come near for fear of sudden death. In iron walls they deem'd me not secure, So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread, That they supposed I could rend bars of steel, And spurn in pieces posts of adamant: Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had, That walked about me every minute-while, And if I did but stir out of my bed, Ready they were to shoot me to the heart. Enter the Boy with a linstock I grieve to hear what torments you endured, But we will be revenged sufficiently Now it is supper-time in Orleans: Here, through this grate, I count each one and view the Frenchmen how they fortify: Let us look in, the sight will much delight thee. Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale, Let me have your express opinions Where is best place to make our battery next. I think, at the north gate, for there stand lords.

Speak, Salisbury, at least, if thou canst speak: How farest thou, mirror of all martial men? One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!

Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive, If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands! Bear hence his body, I will help to bury it. Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life? Speak unto Talbot, nay, look up to him. Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort, Thou shalt not die whiles-- He beckons with his hand and smiles on me. As who should say 'When I am dead and gone, Remember to avenge me on the French.' Plantagenet, I will, and like thee, Nero, Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn: Wretched shall France be only in my name.

Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you: Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish, Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels, And make a quagmire of your mingled brains. Convey me Salisbury into his tent, And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare. Alarum. Exeunt SCENE V. The same. Here an alarum again: and TALBOT pursueth the  DAUPHIN, and driveth him: then enter JOAN LA  PUCELLE, driving Englishmen before her, and exit after them then re-enter TALBOT Where is my strength, my valour, and my force? Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them: A woman clad in armour chaseth them. Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee, Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee: Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch, And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest. Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace thee. Here they fight Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail? My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage",Human
"And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder. But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet. They fight again Talbot, farewell, thy hour is not yet come: I must go victual Orleans forthwith. A short alarum, then enter the town with soldiers O'ertake me, if thou canst, I scorn thy strength. Go, go, cheer up thy hungry-starved men, Help Salisbury to make his testament: This day is ours, as many more shall be. Exit My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel, I know not where I am, nor what I do, A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal, Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists: So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench Are from their hives and houses driven away. They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs, Now, like to whelps, we crying run away. A short alarum Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight, Or tear the lions out of England's coat, Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead: Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf, Or horse or oxen from the leopard, As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves. Alarum. Here another skirmish It will not be: retire into your trenches: You all consented unto Salisbury's death, For none would strike a stroke in his revenge. Pucelle is enter'd into Orleans, In spite of us or aught that we could do. O, would I were to die with Salisbury! The shame hereof will make me hide my head. Exit TALBOT. Alarum, retreat, flourish SCENE VI. The same. Enter, on the walls, JOAN LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, REIGNIER, ALENCON, and Soldiers Advance our waving colours on the walls, Rescued is Orleans from the English Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word. Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter, How shall I honour thee for this success? Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next. France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess! Recover'd is the town of Orleans: More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state. Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town? Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires And feast and banquet in the open streets,",Human
"To celebrate the joy that God hath given us. All France will be replete with mirth and joy, When they shall hear how we have play'd the men. 'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won, For which I will divide my crown with her, And all the priests and friars in my realm Shall in procession sing her endless praise. A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear Than Rhodope's or Memphis' ever was: In memory of her when she is dead, Her ashes, in an urn more precious Than the rich-jewel'd of Darius, Transported shall be at high festivals Before the kings and queens of France. No longer on Saint Denis will we cry, But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint. Come in, and let us banquet royally, After this golden day of victory. Flourish. Exeunt ACT II SCENE I. Before Orleans. Enter a Sergeant of a band with two Sentinels Sirs, take your places and be vigilant: If any noise or soldier you perceive Near to the walls, by some apparent sign Let us have knowledge at the court of guard. Sergeant, you shall. Exit Sergeant Thus are poor servitors, When others sleep upon their quiet beds, Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain and cold. Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, and Forces, with scaling-ladders, their drums beating a dead march Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy, By whose approach the regions of Artois, Wallon and Picardy are friends to us, This happy night the Frenchmen are secure, Having all day caroused and banqueted: Embrace we then this opportunity As fitting best to quittance their deceit Contrived by art and baleful sorcery. Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame, Despairing of his own arm's fortitude, To join with witches and the help of hell! Traitors have never other company. But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure? A maid, they say. A maid! and be so martial! Pray God she prove not masculine ere long, If underneath the standard of the French She carry armour as she hath begun.",Human
"Well, let them practise and converse with spirits: God is our fortress, in whose conquering name Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks. Ascend, brave Talbot, we will follow thee. Not all together: better far, I guess, That we do make our entrance several ways, That, if it chance the one of us do fail, The other yet may rise against their force. Agreed: I'll to yond corner. And I to this. And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave. Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right Of English Henry, shall this night appear How much in duty I am bound to both. Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault! Cry: 'St. George,' 'A Talbot.' The French leap over the walls in their shirts.  Enter, several ways, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, half ready, and half unready How now, my lords! what, all unready so? Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well. 'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds, Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors. Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms, Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise More venturous or desperate than this. I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell. If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him. Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped. Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard. Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame? Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal, Make us partakers of a little gain, That now our loss might be ten times so much? Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend! At all times will you have my power alike? Sleeping or waking must I still prevail, Or will you blame and lay the fault on me? Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good, This sudden mischief never could have fall'n. Duke of Alencon, this was your default, That, being captain of the watch to-night, Did look no better to that weighty charge. Had all your quarters been as safely kept As that whereof I had the government, We had not been thus shamefully surprised. Mine was secure. And so was mine, my lord. And, for myself, most part of all this night, Within her quarter and mine own precinct I was employ'd in passing to and fro,",Human
"About relieving of the sentinels: Then how or which way should they first break in? Question, my lords, no further of the case, How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place But weakly guarded, where the breach was made. And now there rests no other shift but this, To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed, And lay new platforms to endamage them. Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying 'A  Talbot! a Talbot!' They fly, leaving their clothes behind I'll be so bold to take what they have left. The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword, For I have loaden me with many spoils, Using no other weapon but his name. Exit SCENE II. Orleans. Within the town. Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, a Captain, and others The day begins to break, and night is fled, Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth. Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit. Retreat sounded Bring forth the body of old Salisbury, And here advance it in the market-place, The middle centre of this cursed town. Now have I paid my vow unto his soul, For every drop of blood was drawn from him, There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight. And that hereafter ages may behold What ruin happen'd in revenge of him, Within their chiefest temple I'll erect A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd: Upon the which, that every one may read, Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans, The treacherous manner of his mournful death And what a terror he had been to France. But, lords, in all our bloody massacre, I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace, His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc, Nor any of his false confederates. 'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began, Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds, They did amongst the troops of armed men Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field. Myself, as far as I could well discern For smoke and dusky vapours of the night, Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull, When arm in arm they both came swiftly running, Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves That could not live asunder day or night. After that things are set in order here, We'll follow them with all the power we have.",Human
"Enter a Messenger All hail, my lords! which of this princely train Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts So much applauded through the realm of France? Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him? The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne, With modesty admiring thy renown, By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe To visit her poor castle where she lies, That she may boast she hath beheld the man Whose glory fills the world with loud report. Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport, When ladies crave to be encounter'd with. You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit. Ne'er trust me then, for when a world of men Could not prevail with all their oratory, Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled: And therefore tell her I return great thanks, And in submission will attend on her. Will not your honours bear me company? No, truly, it is more than manners will: And I have heard it said, unbidden guests Are often welcomest when they are gone. Well then, alone, since there's no remedy, I mean to prove this lady's courtesy. Come hither, captain. Whispers You perceive my mind? I do, my lord, and mean accordingly. Exeunt SCENE III. Auvergne. The COUNTESS's castle. Enter the COUNTESS and her Porter COUNTESS Porter, remember what I gave in charge, And when you have done so, bring the keys to me. Madam, I will. Exit COUNTESS The plot is laid: if all things fall out right, I shall as famous be by this exploit As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death. Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight, And his achievements of no less account: Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears, To give their censure of these rare reports. Enter Messenger and TALBOT Madam, According as your ladyship desired, By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.",Human
"COUNTESS And he is welcome. What! is this the man? Madam, it is. COUNTESS Is this the scourge of France? Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad That with his name the mothers still their babes? I see report is fabulous and false: I thought I should have seen some Hercules, A second Hector, for his grim aspect, And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs. Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf! It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp Should strike such terror to his enemies. Madam, I have been bold to trouble you, But since your ladyship is not at leisure, I'll sort some other time to visit you. COUNTESS What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes. Stay, my Lord Talbot, for my lady craves To know the cause of your abrupt departure. Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief, I go to certify her Talbot's here. Re-enter Porter with keys COUNTESS If thou be he, then art thou prisoner. Prisoner! to whom? COUNTESS To me, blood-thirsty lord, And for that cause I trained thee to my house. Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me, For in my gallery thy picture hangs: But now the substance shall endure the like, And I will chain these legs and arms of thine, That hast by tyranny these many years Wasted our country, slain our citizens And sent our sons and husbands captivate. Ha, ha, ha! COUNTESS Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan. I laugh to see your ladyship so fond To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow Whereon to practise your severity. COUNTESS Why, art not thou the man? I am indeed. COUNTESS Then have I substance too. No, no, I am but shadow of myself: You are deceived, my substance is not here,",Human
"For what you see is but the smallest part And least proportion of humanity: I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here, It is of such a spacious lofty pitch, Your roof were not sufficient to contain't. COUNTESS This is a riddling merchant for the nonce, He will be here, and yet he is not here: How can these contrarieties agree? That will I show you presently. Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers How say you, madam? are you now persuaded That Talbot is but shadow of himself? These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength, With which he yoketh your rebellious necks, Razeth your cities and subverts your towns And in a moment makes them desolate. COUNTESS Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse: I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited And more than may be gather'd by thy shape. Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath, For I am sorry that with reverence I did not entertain thee as thou art. Be not dismay'd, fair lady, nor misconstrue The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake The outward composition of his body. What you have done hath not offended me, Nor other satisfaction do I crave, But only, with your patience, that we may Taste of your wine and see what cates you have, For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well. COUNTESS With all my heart, and think me honoured To feast so great a warrior in my house. Exeunt SCENE IV. London. The Temple-garden. Enter the Earls of SOMERSET, SUFFOLK, and WARWICK, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, VERNON, and another Lawyer RICHARD Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence? Dare no man answer in a case of truth? Within the Temple-hall we were too loud, The garden here is more convenient. RICHARD Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth, Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error? Faith, I have been a truant in the law, And never yet could frame my will to it, And therefore frame the law unto my will. Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.",Human
"Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch, Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth, Between two blades, which bears the better temper: Between two horses, which doth bear him best, Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye, I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement, But in these nice sharp quillets of the law, Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw. RICHARD Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance: The truth appears so naked on my side That any purblind eye may find it out. And on my side it is so well apparell'd, So clear, so shining and so evident That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye. RICHARD Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak, In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts: Let him that is a true-born gentleman And stands upon the honour of his birth, If he suppose that I have pleaded truth, From off this brier pluck a white rose with me. Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer, But dare maintain the party of the truth, Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me. I love no colours, and without all colour Of base insinuating flattery I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet. I pluck this red rose with young Somerset And say withal I think he held the right. Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more, Till you conclude that he upon whose side The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree Shall yield the other in the right opinion. Good Master Vernon, it is well objected: If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence. RICHARD And I. Then for the truth and plainness of the case. I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here, Giving my verdict on the white rose side. Prick not your finger as you pluck it off, Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red And fall on my side so, against your will. If I my lord, for my opinion bleed, Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt And keep me on the side where still I am. Well, well, come on: who else? Unless my study and my books be false, The argument you held was wrong in you:",Human
"To SOMERSET In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too. RICHARD Now, Somerset, where is your argument? Here in my scabbard, meditating that Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red. RICHARD Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses, For pale they look with fear, as witnessing The truth on our side. No, Plantagenet, 'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses, And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error. RICHARD Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset? Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet? RICHARD Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth, Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood. Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses, That shall maintain what I have said is true, Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen. RICHARD Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand, I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy. Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet. RICHARD Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee. I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat. Away, away, good William de la Pole! We grace the yeoman by conversing with him. Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset, His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence, Third son to the third Edward King of England: Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root? RICHARD He bears him on the place's privilege, Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus. By him that made me, I'll maintain my words On any plot of ground in Christendom. Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge, For treason executed in our late king's days? And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted, Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry? His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood, And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman. RICHARD My father was attached, not attainted, Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor,",Human
"And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset, Were growing time once ripen'd to my will. For your partaker Pole and you yourself, I'll note you in my book of memory, To scourge you for this apprehension: Look to it well and say you are well warn'd. Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still, And know us by these colours for thy foes, For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear. RICHARD And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose, As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate, Will I for ever and my faction wear, Until it wither with me to my grave Or flourish to the height of my degree. Go forward and be choked with thy ambition! And so farewell until I meet thee next. Exit Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious Richard. Exit RICHARD How I am braved and must perforce endure it! This blot that they object against your house Shall be wiped out in the next parliament Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester, And if thou be not then created York, I will not live to be accounted Warwick. Meantime, in signal of my love to thee, Against proud Somerset and William Pole, Will I upon thy party wear this rose: And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day, Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden, Shall send between the red rose and the white A thousand souls to death and deadly night. RICHARD Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you, That you on my behalf would pluck a flower. In your behalf still will I wear the same. And so will I. RICHARD Thanks, gentle sir. Come, let us four to dinner: I dare say This quarrel will drink blood another day. Exeunt SCENE V. The Tower of London. Enter MORTIMER, brought in a chair, and Gaolers Kind keepers of my weak decaying age, Let dying Mortimer here rest himself. Even like a man new haled from the rack, So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.",Human
"And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death, Nestor-like aged in an age of care, Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer. These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent, Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent, Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief, And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine That droops his sapless branches to the ground, Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb, Unable to support this lump of clay, Swift-winged with desire to get a grave, As witting I no other comfort have. But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come? Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come: We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber, And answer was return'd that he will come. Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied. Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine. Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign, Before whose glory I was great in arms, This loathsome sequestration have I had: And even since then hath Richard been obscured, Deprived of honour and inheritance. But now the arbitrator of despairs, Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries, With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence: I would his troubles likewise were expired, That so he might recover what was lost. Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET My lord, your loving nephew now is come. Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come? RICHARD Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used, Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes. Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck, And in his bosom spend my latter gasp: O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks, That I may kindly give one fainting kiss. And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock, Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised? RICHARD First, lean thine aged back against mine arm, And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease. This day, in argument upon a case, Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me, Among which terms he used his lavish tongue And did upbraid me with my father's death: Which obloquy set bars before my tongue, Else with the like I had requited him. Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,",Human
"In honour of a true Plantagenet And for alliance sake, declare the cause My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head. That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine, Was cursed instrument of his decease. RICHARD Discover more at large what cause that was, For I am ignorant and cannot guess. I will, if that my fading breath permit And death approach not ere my tale be done. Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king, Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son, The first-begotten and the lawful heir, Of Edward king, the third of that descent: During whose reign the Percies of the north, Finding his usurpation most unjust, Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne: The reason moved these warlike lords to this Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed, Leaving no heir begotten of his body-- I was the next by birth and parentage, For by my mother I derived am From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son To King Edward the Third, whereas he From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree, Being but fourth of that heroic line. But mark: as in this haughty attempt They laboured to plant the rightful heir, I lost my liberty and they their lives. Long after this, when Henry the Fifth, Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign, Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York, Marrying my sister that thy mother was, Again in pity of my hard distress Levied an army, weening to redeem And have install'd me in the diadem: But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers, In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd. RICHARD Of which, my lord, your honour is the last. True, and thou seest that I no issue have And that my fainting words do warrant death, Thou art my heir, the rest I wish thee gather: But yet be wary in thy studious care. RICHARD Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:",Human
"But yet, methinks, my father's execution Was nothing less than bloody tyranny. With silence, nephew, be thou politic: Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster, And like a mountain, not to be removed. But now thy uncle is removing hence: As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd With long continuance in a settled place. RICHARD O, uncle, would some part of my young years Might but redeem the passage of your age! Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth Which giveth many wounds when one will kill. Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good, Only give order for my funeral: And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes And prosperous be thy life in peace and war! Dies RICHARD And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul! In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage And like a hermit overpass'd thy days. Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast, And what I do imagine let that rest. Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself Will see his burial better than his life. Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out the body of MORTIMER Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer, Choked with ambition of the meaner sort: And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries, Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house: I doubt not but with honour to redress, And therefore haste I to the parliament, Either to be restored to my blood, Or make my ill the advantage of my good. Exit ACT III SCENE I. London. The Parliament-house. Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, EXETER, GLOUCESTER,  WARWICK, SOMERSET, and SUFFOLK, the BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and others.  GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill, BISHOP OF WINCHESTER snatches it, and tears it BISHOP Comest thou with deep premeditated lines, With written pamphlets studiously devised, Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse, Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge, Do it without invention, suddenly, As I with sudden and extemporal speech Purpose to answer what thou canst object. Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience, Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me. Think not, although in writing I preferr'd",Human
"The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes, That therefore I have forged, or am not able Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen: No, prelate, such is thy audacious wickedness, Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks, As very infants prattle of thy pride. Thou art a most pernicious usurer, Forward by nature, enemy to peace, Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems A man of thy profession and degree, And for thy treachery, what's more manifest? In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life, As well at London bridge as at the Tower. Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted, The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt From envious malice of thy swelling heart. BISHOP Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe To give me hearing what I shall reply. If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse, As he will have me, how am I so poor? Or how haps it I seek not to advance Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling? And for dissension, who preferreth peace More than I do?--except I be provoked. No, my good lords, it is not that offends, It is not that that hath incensed the duke: It is, because no one should sway but he, No one but he should be about the king, And that engenders thunder in his breast And makes him roar these accusations forth. But he shall know I am as good-- As good! Thou bastard of my grandfather! BISHOP Ay, lordly sir, for what are you, I pray, But one imperious in another's throne? Am I not protector, saucy priest? BISHOP And am not I a prelate of the church? Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps And useth it to patronage his theft. BISHOP Unreverent Gloster! Thou art reverent Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life. BISHOP Rome shall remedy this. Roam thither, then. My lord, it were your duty to forbear.",Human
"Ay, see the bishop be not overborne. Methinks my lord should be religious And know the office that belongs to such. Methinks his lordship should be humbler, it fitteth not a prelate so to plead. Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near. State holy or unhallow'd, what of that? Is not his grace protector to the king? RICHARD [Aside]  Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue, Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should, Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?' Else would I have a fling at Winchester. Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester, The special watchmen of our English weal, I would prevail, if prayers might prevail, To join your hearts in love and amity. O, what a scandal is it to our crown, That two such noble peers as ye should jar! Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell Civil dissension is a viperous worm That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth. A noise within, 'Down with the tawny-coats!' What tumult's this? An uproar, I dare warrant, Begun through malice of the bishop's men. A noise again, 'Stones! stones!' Enter Mayor O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry, Pity the city of London, pity us! The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men, Forbidden late to carry any weapon, Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones And banding themselves in contrary parts Do pelt so fast at one another's pate That many have their giddy brains knock'd out: Our windows are broke down in every street And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops. Enter Serving-men, in skirmish, with bloody pates We charge you, on allegiance to ourself, To hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace. Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife. First Serving-man	Nay, if we be forbidden stones, We'll fall to it with our teeth. Second Serving-man	Do what ye dare, we are as resolute. Skirmish again You of my household, leave this peevish broil And set this unaccustom'd fight aside. Third Serving-man	My lord, we know your grace to be a man Just and upright, and, for your royal birth, Inferior to none but to his majesty:",Human
"And ere that we will suffer such a prince, So kind a father of the commonweal, To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate, We and our wives and children all will fight And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes. First Serving-man	Ay, and the very parings of our nails Shall pitch a field when we are dead. Begin again Stay, stay, I say! And if you love me, as you say you do, Let me persuade you to forbear awhile. O, how this discord doth afflict my soul! Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold My sighs and tears and will not once relent? Who should be pitiful, if you be not? Or who should study to prefer a peace. If holy churchmen take delight in broils? Yield, my lord protector, yield, Winchester, Except you mean with obstinate repulse To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm. You see what mischief and what murder too Hath been enacted through your enmity, Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood. BISHOP He shall submit, or I will never yield. Compassion on the king commands me stoop, Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest Should ever get that privilege of me. Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke Hath banish'd moody discontented fury, As by his smoothed brows it doth appear: Why look you still so stern and tragical? Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand. Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach That malice was a great and grievous sin, And will not you maintain the thing you teach, But prove a chief offender in the same? Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird. For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent! What, shall a child instruct you what to do? BISHOP Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee, Love for thy love and hand for hand I give. [Aside]  Ay, but, I fear me, with a hollow heart.-- See here, my friends and loving countrymen, This token serveth for a flag of truce Betwixt ourselves and all our followers: So help me God, as I dissemble not!

Exeunt Serving-men, Mayor,  and c Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign, Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet We do exhibit to your majesty. Well urged, my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince, And if your grace mark every circumstance, You have great reason to do Richard right, Especially for those occasions At Eltham Place I told your majesty. And those occasions, uncle, were of force: Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is That Richard be restored to his blood. Let Richard be restored to his blood, So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed. BISHOP As will the rest, so willeth Winchester. If Richard will be true, not that alone But all the whole inheritance I give That doth belong unto the house of York, From whence you spring by lineal descent. RICHARD Thy humble servant vows obedience And humble service till the point of death. Stoop then and set your knee against my foot, And, in reguerdon of that duty done, I gird thee with the valiant sword of York: Rise Richard, like a true Plantagenet, And rise created princely Duke of York. RICHARD And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall! And as my duty springs, so perish they That grudge one thought against your majesty! Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York! [Aside]  Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York! Now will it best avail your majesty To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France: The presence of a king engenders love Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends, As it disanimates his enemies. When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes, For friendly counsel cuts off many foes. Your ships already are in readiness. Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but EXETER",Human
"Ay, we may march in England or in France, Not seeing what is likely to ensue. This late dissension grown betwixt the peers Burns under feigned ashes of forged love And will at last break out into a flame: As fester'd members rot but by degree, Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away, So will this base and envious discord breed. And now I fear that fatal prophecy Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth Was in the mouth of every sucking babe, That Henry born at Monmouth should win all And Henry born at Windsor lose all: Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish His days may finish ere that hapless time. Exit SCENE II. France. Before Rouen. Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE disguised, with four Soldiers with sacks upon their backs These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen, Through which our policy must make a breach: Take heed, be wary how you place your words, Talk like the vulgar sort of market men That come to gather money for their corn. If we have entrance, as I hope we shall, And that we find the slothful watch but weak, I'll by a sign give notice to our friends, That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them. Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city, And we be lords and rulers over Rouen, Therefore we'll knock. Knocks [Within]  Qui est la? Paysans, pauvres gens de France, Poor market folks that come to sell their corn. Enter, go in, the market bell is rung. Now, Rouen, I'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground.

Here enter'd Pucelle and her practisants, Now she is there, how will she specify Where is the best and safest passage in? By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower, Which, once discern'd, shows that her meaning is, No way to that, for weakness, which she enter'd. Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE on the top, thrusting out a torch burning Behold, this is the happy wedding torch That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen, But burning fatal to the Talbotites!",Human
"Exit See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend, The burning torch in yonder turret stands. Now shine it like a comet of revenge, A prophet to the fall of all our foes! Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends, Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently, And then do execution on the watch. Alarum. Exeunt An alarum.

I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast Before he'll buy again at such a rate: 'Twas full of darnel, do you like the taste? Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan! I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own And make thee curse the harvest of that corn. Your grace may starve perhaps before that time. O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason! What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance, And run a tilt at death within a chair? Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite, Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours! Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age And twit with cowardice a man half dead? Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again, Or else let Talbot perish with this shame. Are ye so hot, sir? yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace, If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow. The English whisper together in council God speed the parliament! who shall be the speaker? Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field? Belike your lordship takes us then for fools, To try if that our own be ours or no. I speak not to that railing Hecate, But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest, Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out? Signior, no. Signior, hang! base muleters of France! Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls And dare not take up arms like gentlemen. Away, captains! let's get us from the walls, For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.",Human
"God be wi' you, my lord! we came but to tell you That we are here. Exeunt from the walls And there will we be too, ere it be long, Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame! Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house, Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France, Either to get the town again or die: And I, as sure as English Henry lives And as his father here was conqueror, As sure as in this late-betrayed town Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried, So sure I swear to get the town or die. My vows are equal partners with thy vows. But, ere we go, regard this dying prince, The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord, We will bestow you in some better place, Fitter for sickness and for crazy age. Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me: Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen And will be partner of your weal or woe. Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you. Not to be gone from hence, for once I read That stout Pendragon in his litter sick Came to the field and vanquished his foes: Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts, Because I ever found them as myself. Undaunted spirit in a dying breast! Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe! And now no more ado, brave Burgundy, But gather we our forces out of hand And set upon our boasting enemy. Exeunt all but BEDFORD and Attendants An alarum: excursions. Enter FASTOLFE and a Captain Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste? Whither away! to save myself by flight: We are like to have the overthrow again. What! will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot? Ay, All the Talbots in the world, to save my life! Exit Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee! Exit Retreat: excursions. JOAN LA PUCELLE, ALENCON, and CHARLES fly Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please, For I have seen our enemies' overthrow. What is the trust or strength of foolish man? They that of late were daring with their scoffs Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves. BEDFORD dies, and is carried in by two in his chair",Human
"An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT, BURGUNDY, and the rest Lost, and recover'd in a day again! This is a double honour, Burgundy: Yet heavens have glory for this victory! Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments. Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now? I think her old familiar is asleep: Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks? What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief That such a valiant company are fled. Now will we take some order in the town, Placing therein some expert officers, And then depart to Paris to the king, For there young Henry with his nobles lie. What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy. But yet, before we go, let's not forget The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased, But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen: A braver soldier never couched lance, A gentler heart did never sway in court, But kings and mightiest potentates must die, For that's the end of human misery. Exeunt SCENE III. The plains near Rouen. Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces Dismay not, princes, at this accident, Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered: Care is no cure, but rather corrosive, For things that are not to be remedied. Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while And like a peacock sweep along his tail, We'll pull his plumes and take away his train, If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled. We have been guided by thee hitherto, And of thy cunning had no diffidence: One sudden foil shall never breed distrust. Search out thy wit for secret policies, And we will make thee famous through the world. We'll set thy statue in some holy place, And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint: Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good. Then thus it must be, this doth Joan devise: By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words We will entice the Duke of Burgundy To leave the Talbot and to follow us. Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that, France were no place for Henry's warriors, Nor should that nation boast it so with us,",Human
"But be extirped from our provinces. For ever should they be expulsed from France And not have title of an earldom here. Your honours shall perceive how I will work To bring this matter to the wished end. Drum sounds afar off Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward. Here sound an English march. Enter, and pass over at a distance, TALBOT and his forces There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread, And all the troops of English after him. French march. Enter BURGUNDY and forces Now in the rearward comes the duke and his: Fortune in favour makes him lag behind. Summon a parley, we will talk with him. Trumpets sound a parley A parley with the Duke of Burgundy! Who craves a parley with the Burgundy? The princely Charles of France, thy countryman. What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching hence. Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words. Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France! Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee. Speak on, but be not over-tedious. Look on thy country, look on fertile France, And see the cities and the towns defaced By wasting ruin of the cruel foe. As looks the mother on her lowly babe When death doth close his tender dying eyes, See, see the pining malady of France, Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds, Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast. O, turn thy edged sword another way, Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help. One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore: Return thee therefore with a flood of tears, And wash away thy country's stained spots. Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words, Or nature makes me suddenly relent. Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee, Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny. Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation That will not trust thee but for profit's sake? When Talbot hath set footing once in France And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill, Who then but English Henry will be lord And thou be thrust out like a fugitive? Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof, Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?",Human
"And was he not in England prisoner? But when they heard he was thine enemy, They set him free without his ransom paid, In spite of Burgundy and all his friends. See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen. Come, come, return, return, thou wandering lord: Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms. I am vanquished, these haughty words of hers Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot, And made me almost yield upon my knees. Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen, And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace: My forces and my power of men are yours: So farewell, Talbot, I'll no longer trust thee. [Aside]  Done like a Frenchman: turn, and turn again! Welcome, brave duke! thy friendship makes us fresh. And doth beget new courage in our breasts.

To them with his Soldiers, TALBOT My gracious prince, and honourable peers, Hearing of your arrival in this realm, I have awhile given truce unto my wars, To do my duty to my sovereign: In sign, whereof, this arm, that hath reclaim'd To your obedience fifty fortresses, Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength, Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem, Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet, And with submissive loyalty of heart Ascribes the glory of his conquest got First to my God and next unto your grace. Kneels Is this the Lord Talbot, uncle Gloucester, That hath so long been resident in France? Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege. Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord! When I was young, as yet I am not old, I do remember how my father said A stouter champion never handled sword. Long since we were resolved of your truth, Your faithful service and your toil in war, Yet never have you tasted our reward, Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks, Because till now we never saw your face:",Human

Enter FASTOLFE My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais, To haste unto your coronation, A letter was deliver'd to my hands, Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy. Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee! I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next, To tear the garter from thy craven's leg, Plucking it off Which I have done, because unworthily Thou wast installed in that high degree. Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest This dastard, at the battle of Patay, When but in all I was six thousand strong",Human
"And that the French were almost ten to one, Before we met or that a stroke was given, Like to a trusty squire did run away: In which assault we lost twelve hundred men, Myself and divers gentlemen beside Were there surprised and taken prisoners. Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss, Or whether that such cowards ought to wear This ornament of knighthood, yea or no. To say the truth, this fact was infamous And ill beseeming any common man, Much more a knight, a captain and a leader. When first this order was ordain'd, my lords, Knights of the garter were of noble birth, Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage, Such as were grown to credit by the wars, Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress, But always resolute in most extremes. He then that is not furnish'd in this sort Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight, Profaning this most honourable order, And should, if I were worthy to be judge, Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain That doth presume to boast of gentle blood. Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom! Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight: Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death. Exit FASTOLFE And now, my lord protector, view the letter Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy. What means his grace, that he hath changed his style? No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!' Hath he forgot he is his sovereign? Or doth this churlish superscription Pretend some alteration in good will? What's here? Reads 'I have, upon especial cause, Moved with compassion of my country's wreck, Together with the pitiful complaints Of such as your oppression feeds upon, Forsaken your pernicious faction And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.' O monstrous treachery! can this be so, That in alliance, amity and oaths, There should be found such false dissembling guile? What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt? He doth, my lord, and is become your foe. Is that the worst this letter doth contain? It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.",Human
"Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him And give him chastisement for this abuse. How say you, my lord? are you not content? Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented, I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd. Then gather strength and march unto him straight: Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason And what offence it is to flout his friends. I go, my lord, in heart desiring still You may behold confusion of your foes. Exit Enter VERNON and BASSET Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign. And me, my lord, grant me the combat too. This is my servant: hear him, noble prince. And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him. Be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak. Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim? And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom? With him, my lord, for he hath done me wrong. And I with him, for he hath done me wrong. What is that wrong whereof you both complain? First let me know, and then I'll answer you. Crossing the sea from England into France, This fellow here, with envious carping tongue, Upbraided me about the rose I wear, Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves Did represent my master's blushing cheeks, When stubbornly he did repugn the truth About a certain question in the law Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him, With other vile and ignominious terms: In confutation of which rude reproach And in defence of my lord's worthiness, I crave the benefit of law of arms. And that is my petition, noble lord: For though he seem with forged quaint conceit To set a gloss upon his bold intent, Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him, And he first took exceptions at this badge, Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart. Will not this malice, Somerset, be left? Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out, Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it. Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men, When for so slight and frivolous a cause Such factious emulations shall arise! Good cousins both, of York and Somerset, Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.",Human
"Let this dissension first be tried by fight, And then your highness shall command a peace. The quarrel toucheth none but us alone, Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then. There is my pledge, accept it, Somerset. Nay, let it rest where it began at first. Confirm it so, mine honourable lord. Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife! And perish ye, with your audacious prate! Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed With this immodest clamorous outrage To trouble and disturb the king and us? And you, my lords, methinks you do not well To bear with their perverse objections, Much less to take occasion from their mouths To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves: Let me persuade you take a better course. It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends. Come hither, you that would be combatants: Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour, Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause. And you, my lords, remember where we are, In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation: If they perceive dissension in our looks And that within ourselves we disagree, How will their grudging stomachs be provoked To wilful disobedience, and rebel! Beside, what infamy will there arise, When foreign princes shall be certified That for a toy, a thing of no regard, King Henry's peers and chief nobility Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France! O, think upon the conquest of my father, My tender years, and let us not forego That for a trifle that was bought with blood Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife. I see no reason, if I wear this rose, Putting on a red rose That any one should therefore be suspicious I more incline to Somerset than York: Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both: As well they may upbraid me with my crown, Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd. But your discretions better can persuade Than I am able to instruct or teach: And therefore, as we hither came in peace, So let us still continue peace and love.

An if I wist he did,--but let it rest, Other affairs must now be managed. Exeunt all but EXETER Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice, For, had the passions of thy heart burst out, I fear we should have seen decipher'd there More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils, Than yet can be imagined or supposed. But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees This jarring discord of nobility, This shouldering of each other in the court, This factious bandying of their favourites, But that it doth presage some ill event.

Is my name Talbot? and am I your son? And shall I fly? O if you love my mother, Dishonour not her honourable name, To make a bastard and a slave of me!

If we both stay, we both are sure to die. Then let me stay, and, father, do you fly: Your loss is great, so your regard should be, My worth unknown, no loss is known in me. Upon my death the French can little boast, In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost. Flight cannot stain the honour you have won, But mine it will, that no exploit have done: You fled for vantage, everyone will swear, But, if I bow, they'll say it was for fear. There is no hope that ever I will stay, If the first hour I shrink and run away. Here on my knee I beg mortality, Rather than life preserved with infamy. Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb? Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb. Upon my blessing, I command thee go. To fight I will, but not to fly the foe. Part of thy father may be saved in thee. No part of him but will be shame in me. Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it. Yes, your renowned name: shall flight abuse it? Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain. You cannot witness for me, being slain. If death be so apparent, then both fly. And leave my followers here to fight and die?",Human
"My age was never tainted with such shame. And shall my youth be guilty of such blame? No more can I be sever'd from your side, Than can yourself yourself in twain divide: Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I, For live I will not, if my father die. Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son, Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon. Come, side by side together live and die. And soul with soul from France to heaven fly. Exeunt SCENE VI. A field of battle. Alarum: excursions, wherein JOHN TALBOT is hemmed about, and TALBOT rescues him Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight. The regent hath with Talbot broke his word And left us to the rage of France his sword. Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath, I gave thee life and rescued thee from death. O, twice my father, twice am I thy son! The life thou gavest me first was lost and done, Till with thy warlike sword, despite of late, To my determined time thou gavest new date. When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire, It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age, Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage, Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy, And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee. The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood Of thy first fight, I soon encountered, And interchanging blows I quickly shed Some of his bastard blood, and in disgrace Bespoke him thus, 'Contaminated, base And misbegotten blood I spill of thine, Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:' Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy, Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care, Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare? Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly, Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry? Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead: The help of one stands me in little stead. O, too much folly is it, well I wot, To hazard all our lives in one small boat! If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage, To-morrow I shall die with mickle age: By me they nothing gain an if I stay, 'Tis but the shortening of my life one day:",Human
"In thee thy mother dies, our household's name, My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame: All these and more we hazard by thy stay, All these are saved if thou wilt fly away. The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart, These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart: On that advantage, bought with such a shame, To save a paltry life and slay bright fame, Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly, The coward horse that bears me fail and die! And like me to the peasant boys of France, To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance! Surely, by all the glory you have won, An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son: Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot, If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot. Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete, Thou Icarus, thy life to me is sweet: If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side, And, commendable proved, let's die in pride. Exeunt SCENE VII. Another part of the field. Alarum: excursions. Enter TALBOT led by a Servant Where is my other life? mine own is gone, O, where's young Talbot? where is valiant John? Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity, Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee: When he perceived me shrink and on my knee, His bloody sword he brandish'd over me, And, like a hungry lion, did commence Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience, But when my angry guardant stood alone, Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none, Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart Suddenly made him from my side to start Into the clustering battle of the French, And in that sea of blood my boy did drench His over-mounting spirit, and there died, My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride. O, my dear lord, lo, where your son is borne! Enter Soldiers, with the body of JOHN TALBOT Thou antic death, which laugh'st us here to scorn, Anon, from thy insulting tyranny, Coupled in bonds of perpetuity, Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky, In thy despite shall 'scape mortality. O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour'd death, Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath! Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no, Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.",Human
"Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say, Had death been French, then death had died to-day. Come, come and lay him in his father's arms: My spirit can no longer bear these harms. Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have, Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave. Dies Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BURGUNDY, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces Had York and Somerset brought rescue in, We should have found a bloody day of this. How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging-wood, Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood! Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said: 'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid:' But, with a proud majestical high scorn, He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born To be the pillage of a giglot wench:' So, rushing in the bowels of the French, He left me proudly, as unworthy fight. Doubtless he would have made a noble knight, See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms Of the most bloody nurser of his harms! Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder Whose life was England's glory, Gallia's wonder. O, no, forbear! for that which we have fled During the life, let us not wrong it dead. Enter Sir William LUCY, attended, Herald of the French preceding Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent, To know who hath obtained the glory of the day. On what submissive message art thou sent? Submission, Dauphin! 'tis a mere French word, We English warriors wot not what it means. I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en And to survey the bodies of the dead. For prisoners ask'st thou? hell our prison is. But tell me whom thou seek'st. But where's the great Alcides of the field, Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, Created, for his rare success in arms, Great Earl of Washford, Waterford and Valence, Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield, Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdun of Alton, Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Sheffield, The thrice-victorious Lord of Falconbridge, Knight of the noble order of Saint George, Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece, Great marshal to Henry the Sixth Of all his wars within the realm of France? Here is a silly stately style indeed! The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath,",Human
"Writes not so tedious a style as this. Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet. Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen's only scourge, Your kingdom's terror and black Nemesis? O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd, That I in rage might shoot them at your faces! O, that I could but call these dead to life! It were enough to fright the realm of France: Were but his picture left amongst you here, It would amaze the proudest of you all. Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence And give them burial as beseems their worth. I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost, He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit. For God's sake let him have 'em, to keep them here, They would but stink, and putrefy the air. Go, take their bodies hence. I'll bear them hence, but from their ashes shall be rear'd A phoenix that shall make all France afeard. So we be rid of them, do with 'em what thou wilt. And now to Paris, in this conquering vein: All will be ours, now bloody Talbot's slain. Exeunt ACT V SCENE I. London. The palace. Sennet.

How doth your grace affect their motion? Well, my good lord, and as the only means To stop effusion of our Christian blood And 'stablish quietness on every side. Ay, marry, uncle, for I always thought It was both impious and unnatural That such immanity and bloody strife Should reign among professors of one faith. Beside, my lord, the sooner to effect And surer bind this knot of amity, The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles, A man of great authority in France, Proffers his only daughter to your grace In marriage, with a large and sumptuous dowry.

Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER in Cardinal's habit, a Legate and two Ambassadors What! is my Lord of Winchester install'd, And call'd unto a cardinal's degree? Then I perceive that will be verified Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy, 'If once he come to be a cardinal, He'll make his cap co-equal with the crown.' My lords ambassadors, your several suits Have been consider'd and debated on. And therefore are we certainly resolved To draw conditions of a friendly peace, Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean Shall be transported presently to France. And for the proffer of my lord your master, I have inform'd his highness so at large As liking of the lady's virtuous gifts, Her beauty and the value of her dower, He doth intend she shall be England's queen.

I will attend upon your lordship's leisure. CARDINAL [Aside]  Now Winchester will not submit, I trow, Or be inferior to the proudest peer.

Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France, And keep not back your powers in dalliance.",Human
"Peace be amongst them, if they turn to us, Else, ruin combat with their palaces! Enter Scout Success unto our valiant general, And happiness to his accomplices! What tidings send our scouts? I prithee, speak. The English army, that divided was Into two parties, is now conjoined in one, And means to give you battle presently. Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is, But we will presently provide for them. I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there: Now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear. Of all base passions, fear is most accursed. Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine, Let Henry fret and all the world repine. Then on, my lords, and France be fortunate! Exeunt SCENE III.

Curse, miscreant, when thou comest to the stake. Exeunt Alarum. Enter SUFFOLK with MARGARET in his hand Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner. Gazes on her O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly! For I will touch thee but with reverent hands, I kiss these fingers for eternal peace, And lay them gently on thy tender side. Who art thou? say, that I may honour thee. Margaret my name, and daughter to a king, The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art. An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd. Be not offended, nature's miracle, Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me: So doth the swan her downy cygnets save, Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings. Yet, if this servile usage once offend. Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend. She is going O, stay! I have no power to let her pass, My hand would free her, but my heart says no As plays the sun upon the glassy streams, Twinkling another counterfeited beam, So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes. Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak: I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind. Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself, Hast not a tongue? is she not here?",Human
"Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight? Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such, Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough. Say, Earl of Suffolk--if thy name be so-- What ransom must I pay before I pass? For I perceive I am thy prisoner. How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit, Before thou make a trial of her love? Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay? She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd, She is a woman, therefore to be won. Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no. Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife, Then how can Margaret be thy paramour? I were best to leave him, for he will not hear. There all is marr'd, there lies a cooling card. He talks at random, sure, the man is mad. And yet a dispensation may be had. And yet I would that you would answer me. I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom? Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing! He talks of wood: it is some carpenter. Yet so my fancy may be satisfied, And peace established between these realms But there remains a scruple in that too, For though her father be the King of Naples, Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor, And our nobility will scorn the match. Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure? It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much. Henry is youthful and will quickly yield. Madam, I have a secret to reveal. What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight, And will not any way dishonour me. Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say. Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French, And then I need not crave his courtesy. Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause-- Tush, women have been captivate ere now. Lady, wherefore talk you so? I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo. Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose Your bondage happy, to be made a queen? To be a queen in bondage is more vile Than is a slave in base servility, For princes should be free. And so shall you, If happy England's royal king be free. Why, what concerns his freedom unto me? I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,",Human
"To put a golden sceptre in thy hand And set a precious crown upon thy head, If thou wilt condescend to be my-- What? His love. I am unworthy to be Henry's wife. No, gentle madam, I unworthy am To woo so fair a dame to be his wife, And have no portion in the choice myself. How say you, madam, are ye so content? An if my father please, I am content. Then call our captains and our colours forth. And, madam, at your father's castle walls We'll crave a parley, to confer with him. A parley sounded. Enter REIGNIER on the walls See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner! To whom? To me. Suffolk, what remedy? I am a soldier, and unapt to weep, Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness. Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord: Consent, and for thy honour give consent, Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king, Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto, And this her easy-held imprisonment Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty. Speaks Suffolk as he thinks? Fair Margaret knows That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign. Upon thy princely warrant, I descend To give thee answer of thy just demand. Exit from the walls And here I will expect thy coming. Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER, below Welcome, brave earl, into our territories: Command in Anjou what your honour pleases. Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child, Fit to be made companion with a king: What answer makes your grace unto my suit? Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth To be the princely bride of such a lord, Upon condition I may quietly Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou, Free from oppression or the stroke of war, My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.

So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe In golden palaces, as it becomes. I do embrace thee, as I would embrace The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here. Farewell, my lord: good wishes, praise and prayers Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret. Going Farewell, sweet madam: but hark you, Margaret, No princely commendations to my king? Such commendations as becomes a maid, A virgin and his servant, say to him. Words sweetly placed and modestly directed. But madam, I must trouble you again, No loving token to his majesty? Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart, Never yet taint with love, I send the king. And this withal. Kisses her That for thyself: I will not so presume To send such peevish tokens to a king. Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay, Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth, There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk. Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise: Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount, And natural graces that extinguish art, Repeat their semblance often on the seas, That, when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet, Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.

My lords, an please you, 'tis not so, I did beget her, all the parish knows: Her mother liveth yet, can testify She was the first fruit of my bachelorship. Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage? This argues what her kind of life hath been, Wicked and vile, and so her death concludes. Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle! God knows thou art a collop of my flesh, And for thy sake have I shed many a tear: Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan. Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man, Of purpose to obscure my noble birth. 'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest The morn that I was wedded to her mother. Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl. Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time Of thy nativity! I would the milk Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast, Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake! Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field, I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee! Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab? O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good. Exit Take her away, for she hath lived too long, To fill the world with vicious qualities. First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd: Not me begotten of a shepherd swain, But issued from the progeny of kings, Virtuous and holy, chosen from above, By inspiration of celestial grace, To work exceeding miracles on earth. I never had to do with wicked spirits: But you, that are polluted with your lusts, Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents, Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices, Because you want the grace that others have, You judge it straight a thing impossible To compass wonders but by help of devils. No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been A virgin from her tender infancy, Chaste and immaculate in very thought, Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused, Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven. Ay, ay: away with her to execution! And hark ye, sirs, because she is a maid, Spare for no faggots, let there be enow:",Human

The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought: Is all your strict preciseness come to this? She and the Dauphin have been juggling: I did imagine what would be her refuge. Well, go to, we'll have no bastards live, Especially since Charles must father it. You are deceived, my child is none of his: It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love. Alencon! that notorious Machiavel! It dies, an if it had a thousand lives. O, give me leave, I have deluded you: 'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named, But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail'd. A married man! that's most intolerable. Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well, There were so many, whom she may accuse. It's sign she hath been liberal and free. And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure. Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee: Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.

For know, my lords, the states of Christendom, Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils, Have earnestly implored a general peace Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French, And here at hand the Dauphin and his train Approacheth, to confer about some matter. Is all our travail turn'd to this effect? After the slaughter of so many peers,",Human
"So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers, That in this quarrel have been overthrown And sold their bodies for their country's benefit, Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace? Have we not lost most part of all the towns, By treason, falsehood and by treachery, Our great progenitors had conquered? O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief The utter loss of all the realm of France. Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace, It shall be with such strict and severe covenants As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby. Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, REIGNIER, and others Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France, We come to be informed by yourselves What the conditions of that league must be. Speak, Winchester, for boiling choler chokes The hollow passage of my poison'd voice, By sight of these our baleful enemies. CARDINAL Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus: That, in regard King Henry gives consent, Of mere compassion and of lenity, To ease your country of distressful war, And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace, You shall become true liegemen to his crown: And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear To pay him tribute, submit thyself, Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him, And still enjoy thy regal dignity. Must he be then as shadow of himself? Adorn his temples with a coronet, And yet, in substance and authority, Retain but privilege of a private man? This proffer is absurd and reasonless. 'Tis known already that I am possess'd With more than half the Gallian territories, And therein reverenced for their lawful king: Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd, Detract so much from that prerogative, As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole? No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep That which I have than, coveting for more, Be cast from possibility of all. Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means Used intercession to obtain a league, And, now the matter grows to compromise, Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison? Either accept the title thou usurp'st,",Human
"Of benefit proceeding from our king And not of any challenge of desert, Or we will plague thee with incessant wars. My lord, you do not well in obstinacy To cavil in the course of this contract: If once it be neglected, ten to one We shall not find like opportunity. To say the truth, it is your policy To save your subjects from such massacre And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen By our proceeding in hostility, And therefore take this compact of a truce, Although you break it when your pleasure serves. How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand? It shall, Only reserved, you claim no interest In any of our towns of garrison. Then swear allegiance to his majesty, As thou art knight, never to disobey Nor be rebellious to the crown of England, Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England. So, now dismiss your army when ye please: Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still, For here we entertain a solemn peace. Exeunt SCENE V. London. The palace. Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER and EXETER Your wondrous rare description, noble earl, Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me: Her virtues graced with external gifts Do breed love's settled passions in my heart: And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide, So am I driven by breath of her renown Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive Where I may have fruition of her love. Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale Is but a preface of her worthy praise, The chief perfections of that lovely dame Had I sufficient skill to utter them, Would make a volume of enticing lines, Able to ravish any dull conceit: And, which is more, she is not so divine, So full-replete with choice of all delights, But with as humble lowliness of mind She is content to be at your command, Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents, To love and honour Henry as her lord. And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume. Therefore, my lord protector, give consent",Human
"That Margaret may be England's royal queen. So should I give consent to flatter sin. You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd Unto another lady of esteem: How shall we then dispense with that contract, And not deface your honour with reproach? As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths, Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists By reason of his adversary's odds: A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds, And therefore may be broke without offence. Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that? Her father is no better than an earl, Although in glorious titles he excel. Yes, lord, her father is a king, The King of Naples and Jerusalem, And of such great authority in France As his alliance will confirm our peace And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance. And so the Earl of Armagnac may do, Because he is near kinsman unto Charles. Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower, Where Reignier sooner will receive than give. A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king, That he should be so abject, base and poor, To choose for wealth and not for perfect love. Henry is able to enrich his queen And not seek a queen to make him rich: So worthless peasants bargain for their wives, As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse. Marriage is a matter of more worth Than to be dealt in by attorneyship, Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects, Must be companion of his nuptial bed: And therefore, lords, since he affects her most, It most of all these reasons bindeth us, In our opinions she should be preferr'd. For what is wedlock forced but a hell, An age of discord and continual strife? Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss, And is a pattern of celestial peace. Whom should we match with Henry, being a king, But Margaret, that is daughter to a king? Her peerless feature, joined with her birth, Approves her fit for none but for a king: Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit, More than in women commonly is seen, Will answer our hope in issue of a king, For Henry, son unto a conqueror,",Human
"Is likely to beget more conquerors, If with a lady of so high resolve As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love. Then yield, my lords, and here conclude with me That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she. Whether it be through force of your report, My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that My tender youth was never yet attaint With any passion of inflaming love, I cannot tell, but this I am assured, I feel such sharp dissension in my breast, Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear, As I am sick with working of my thoughts. Take, therefore, shipping, post, my lord, to France, Agree to any covenants, and procure That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come To cross the seas to England and be crown'd King Henry's faithful and anointed queen: For your expenses and sufficient charge, Among the people gather up a tenth. Be gone, I say, for, till you do return, I rest perplexed with a thousand cares. And you, good uncle, banish all offence: If you do censure me by what you were, Not what you are, I know it will excuse This sudden execution of my will. And so, conduct me where, from company, I may revolve and ruminate my grief. Exit Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last. Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd, and thus he goes, As did the youthful Paris once to Greece, With hope to find the like event in love, But prosper better than the Trojan did. Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king, But I will rule both her, the king and realm. Exit ACT I SCENE I. London. The palace. Flourish of trumpets: then hautboys. Enter KING  HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and  CARDINAL, on the one side, QUEEN MARGARET, SUFFOLK, YORK, SOMERSET, and BUCKINGHAM, on the other As by your high imperial majesty I had in charge at my depart for France, As procurator to your excellence, To marry Princess Margaret for your grace, So, in the famous ancient city, Tours, In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil, The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon, Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops, I have perform'd my task and was espoused:",Human
"And humbly now upon my bended knee, In sight of England and her lordly peers, Deliver up my title in the queen To your most gracious hands, that are the substance Of that great shadow I did represent, The happiest gift that ever marquess gave, The fairest queen that ever king received. Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret: I can express no kinder sign of love Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life, Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness! For thou hast given me in this beauteous face A world of earthly blessings to my soul, If sympathy of love unite our thoughts. Great King of England and my gracious lord, The mutual conference that my mind hath had, By day, by night, waking and in my dreams, In courtly company or at my beads, With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign, Makes me the bolder to salute my king With ruder terms, such as my wit affords And over-joy of heart doth minister. Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech, Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty, Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys, Such is the fulness of my heart's content. Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love. [Kneeling]  Long live Queen Margaret, England's happiness! We thank you all. Flourish My lord protector, so it please your grace, Here are the articles of contracted peace Between our sovereign and the French king Charles, For eighteen months concluded by consent. [Reads]  'Imprimis, it is agreed between the French king Charles, and William de la Pole, Marquess of Suffolk, ambassador for Henry King of England, that the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret, daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia and Jerusalem, and crown her Queen of England ere the thirtieth of May next ensuing. Item, that the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released and delivered to the king her father'-- Lets the paper fall Uncle, how now! Pardon me, gracious lord, Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further. Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.",Human
"[Reads]  'Item, It is further agreed between them, that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered over to the king her father, and she sent over of the King of England's own proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.' They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel down: We here create thee the first duke of Suffolk, And gird thee with the sword. Cousin of York, We here discharge your grace from being regent I' the parts of France, till term of eighteen months Be full expired. Thanks, uncle Winchester, Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset, Salisbury, and Warwick, We thank you all for the great favour done, In entertainment to my princely queen. Come, let us in, and with all speed provide To see her coronation be perform'd. Exeunt KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and SUFFOLK Brave peers of England, pillars of the state, To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief, Your grief, the common grief of all the land. What! did my brother Henry spend his youth, His valour, coin and people, in the wars? Did he so often lodge in open field, In winter's cold and summer's parching heat, To conquer France, his true inheritance? And did my brother Bedford toil his wits, To keep by policy what Henry got? Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham, Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick, Received deep scars in France and Normandy? Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself, With all the learned council of the realm, Studied so long, sat in the council-house Early and late, debating to and fro How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe, And had his highness in his infancy Crowned in Paris in despite of foes? And shall these labours and these honours die? Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance, Your deeds of war and all our counsel die? O peers of England, shameful is this league! Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame, Blotting your names from books of memory, Razing the characters of your renown, Defacing monuments of conquer'd France, Undoing all, as all had never been! Nephew, what means this passionate discourse, This peroration with such circumstance? For France, 'tis ours, and we will keep it still.",Human
"Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can, But now it is impossible we should: Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast, Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style Agrees not with the leanness of his purse. Now, by the death of Him that died for all, These counties were the keys of Normandy. But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son? For grief that they are past recovery: For, were there hope to conquer them again, My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears. Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both, Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer: And are the cities, that I got with wounds, Delivered up again with peaceful words? Mort Dieu! For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate, That dims the honour of this warlike isle! France should have torn and rent my very heart, Before I would have yielded to this league. I never read but England's kings have had Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives: And our King Henry gives away his own, To match with her that brings no vantages. A proper jest, and never heard before, That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth For costs and charges in transporting her! She should have stayed in France and starved in France, Before-- My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot: It was the pleasure of my lord the King. My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind, 'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike, But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye. Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face I see thy fury: if I longer stay, We shall begin our ancient bickerings. Lordings, farewell, and say, when I am gone, I prophesied France will be lost ere long. Exit So, there goes our protector in a rage. 'Tis known to you he is mine enemy, Nay, more, an enemy unto you all, And no great friend, I fear me, to the king. Consider, lords, he is the next of blood, And heir apparent to the English crown: Had Henry got an empire by his marriage, And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west, There's reason he should be displeased at it.",Human
"Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words Bewitch your hearts, be wise and circumspect. What though the common people favour him, Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester,' Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice, 'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!' With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!' I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss, He will be found a dangerous protector. Why should he, then, protect our sovereign, He being of age to govern of himself? Cousin of Somerset, join you with me, And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk, We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat. This weighty business will not brook delay: I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently. Exit Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride And greatness of his place be grief to us, Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal: His insolence is more intolerable Than all the princes in the land beside: If Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector. Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector, Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal. Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET Pride went before, ambition follows him. While these do labour for their own preferment, Behoves it us to labour for the realm. I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester Did bear him like a noble gentleman. Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal, More like a soldier than a man o' the church, As stout and proud as he were lord of all, Swear like a ruffian and demean himself Unlike the ruler of a commonweal. Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age, Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping, Hath won the greatest favour of the commons, Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey: And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland, In bringing them to civil discipline, Thy late exploits done in the heart of France, When thou wert regent for our sovereign, Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people: Join we together, for the public good, In what we can, to bridle and suppress The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal, With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition,",Human
"And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds, While they do tend the profit of the land. So God help Warwick, as he loves the land, And common profit of his country! [Aside]  And so says York, for he hath greatest cause. Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main. Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost, That Maine which by main force Warwick did win, And would have kept so long as breath did last! Main chance, father, you meant, but I meant Maine, Which I will win from France, or else be slain, Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY Anjou and Maine are given to the French, Paris is lost, the state of Normandy Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone: Suffolk concluded on the articles, The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter. I cannot blame them all: what is't to them? 'Tis thine they give away, and not their own. Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage And purchase friends and give to courtezans, Still revelling like lords till all be gone, While as the silly owner of the goods Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof, While all is shared and all is borne away, Ready to starve and dare not touch his own: So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue, While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold. Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood As did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd Unto the prince's heart of Calydon. Anjou and Maine both given unto the French! Cold news for me, for I had hope of France, Even as I have of fertile England's soil. A day will come when York shall claim his own, And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey, And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown, For that's the golden mark I seek to hit: Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right, Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist, Nor wear the diadem upon his head, Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown. Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve: Watch thou and wake when others be asleep, To pry into the secrets of the state, Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,",Human
"With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen, And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars: Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose, With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed, And in my standard bear the arms of York To grapple with the house of Lancaster, And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown, Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down. Exit SCENE II. GLOUCESTER'S house. Enter GLOUCESTER and his DUCHESS Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn, Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load? Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows, As frowning at the favours of the world? Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth, Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight? What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem, Enchased with all the honours of the world? If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face, Until thy head be circled with the same. Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold. What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine: And, having both together heaved it up, We'll both together lift our heads to heaven, And never more abase our sight so low As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground. O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord, Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts. And may that thought, when I imagine ill Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry, Be my last breathing in this mortal world! My troublous dream this night doth make me sad. What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite it With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream. Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court, Was broke in twain, by whom I have forgot, But, as I think, it was by the cardinal, And on the pieces of the broken wand Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset, And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk. This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows. Tut, this was nothing but an argument That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove Shall lose his head for his presumption. But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke: Methought I sat in seat of majesty In the cathedral church of Westminster, And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd, Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me",Human
"And on my head did set the diadem. Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright: Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor, Art thou not second woman in the realm, And the protector's wife, beloved of him? Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command, Above the reach or compass of thy thought? And wilt thou still be hammering treachery, To tumble down thy husband and thyself From top of honour to disgrace's feet? Away from me, and let me hear no more! What, what, my lord! are you so choleric With Eleanor, for telling but her dream? Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself, And not be cheque'd. Nay, be not angry, I am pleased again. Enter Messenger My lord protector, 'tis his highness' pleasure You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's, Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk. I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us? Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently. Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Messenger Follow I must, I cannot go before, While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind. Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood, I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks And smooth my way upon their headless necks, And, being a woman, I will not be slack To play my part in Fortune's pageant. Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man, We are alone, here's none but thee and I. Enter HUME Jesus preserve your royal majesty! What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace. But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice, Your grace's title shall be multiplied. What say'st thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr'd With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch, With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer? And will they undertake to do me good? This they have promised, to show your highness A spirit raised from depth of under-ground, That shall make answer to such questions As by your grace shall be propounded him. It is enough, I'll think upon the questions: When from St. Alban's we do make return, We'll see these things effected to the full. Here, Hume, take this reward, make merry, man, With thy confederates in this weighty cause.",Human
"Exit Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold, Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume! Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum: The business asketh silent secrecy. Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch: Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil. Yet have I gold flies from another coast, I dare not say, from the rich cardinal And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk, Yet I do find it so, for to be plain, They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour, Have hired me to undermine the duchess And buz these conjurations in her brain. They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker,' Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker. Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near To call them both a pair of crafty knaves. Well, so it stands, and thus, I fear, at last Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck, And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall: Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all. Exit SCENE III. The palace. Enter three or four Petitioners, PETER, the Armourer's man, being one My masters, let's stand close: my lord protector will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver our supplications in the quill. Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good man! Jesu bless him! Enter SUFFOLK and QUEEN MARGARET Here a' comes, methinks, and the queen with him. I'll be the first, sure. Come back, fool, this is the Duke of Suffolk, and not my lord protector. How now, fellow! would'st anything with me? I pray, my lord, pardon me, I took ye for my lord protector. [Reading]  'To my Lord Protector!' Are your supplications to his lordship? Let me see them: what is thine? Mine is, an't please your grace, against John Goodman, my lord cardinal's man, for keeping my house, and lands, and wife and all, from me. Thy wife, too! that's some wrong, indeed. What's yours? What's here! Reads 'Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing the commons of Melford.' How now, sir knave! Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township.",Human
"[Giving his petition]  Against my master, Thomas Horner, for saying that the Duke of York was rightful heir to the crown. What sayst thou? did the Duke of York say he was rightful heir to the crown? That my master was? no, forsooth: my master said that he was, and that the king was an usurper. Who is there? Enter Servant Take this fellow in, and send for his master with a pursuivant presently: we'll hear more of your matter before the King. Exit Servant with PETER And as for you, that love to be protected Under the wings of our protector's grace, Begin your suits anew, and sue to him. Tears the supplication Away, base cullions! Suffolk, let them go. Come, let's be gone. Exeunt My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise, Is this the fashion in the court of England? Is this the government of Britain's isle, And this the royalty of Albion's king? What shall King Henry be a pupil still Under the surly Gloucester's governance? Am I a queen in title and in style, And must be made a subject to a duke? I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love And stolest away the ladies' hearts of France, I thought King Henry had resembled thee In courage, courtship and proportion: But all his mind is bent to holiness, To number Ave-Maries on his beads, His champions are the prophets and apostles, His weapons holy saws of sacred writ, His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves Are brazen images of canonized saints. I would the college of the cardinals Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome, And set the triple crown upon his head: That were a state fit for his holiness. Madam, be patient: as I was cause Your highness came to England, so will I In England work your grace's full content. Beside the haughty protector, have we Beaufort, The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham, And grumbling York: and not the least of these But can do more in England than the king.",Human
"And he of these that can do most of all Cannot do more in England than the Nevils: Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers. Not all these lords do vex me half so much As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife. She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies, More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife: Strangers in court do take her for the queen: She bears a duke's revenues on her back, And in her heart she scorns our poverty: Shall I not live to be avenged on her? Contemptuous base-born callet as she is, She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day, The very train of her worst wearing gown Was better worth than all my father's lands, Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter. Madam, myself have limed a bush for her, And placed a quire of such enticing birds, That she will light to listen to the lays, And never mount to trouble you again. So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me, For I am bold to counsel you in this. Although we fancy not the cardinal, Yet must we join with him and with the lords, Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace. As for the Duke of York, this late complaint Will make but little for his benefit. So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last, And you yourself shall steer the happy helm. Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER,  CARDINAL, BUCKINGHAM, YORK, SOMERSET, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and the DUCHESS For my part, noble lords, I care not which, Or Somerset or York, all's one to me. If York have ill demean'd himself in France, Then let him be denay'd the regentship. If Somerset be unworthy of the place, Let York be regent, I will yield to him. Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no, Dispute not that: York is the worthier. Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak. The cardinal's not my better in the field. All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick. Warwick may live to be the best of all. Peace, son! and show some reason, Buckingham, Why Somerset should be preferred in this. Because the king, forsooth, will have it so. Madam, the king is old enough himself To give his censure: these are no women's matters. If he be old enough, what needs your grace To be protector of his excellence? Madam, I am protector of the realm,",Human
"And, at his pleasure, will resign my place. Resign it then and leave thine insolence. Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?-- The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck, The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas, And all the peers and nobles of the realm Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty. The commons hast thou rack'd, the clergy's bags Are lank and lean with thy extortions. Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire Have cost a mass of public treasury. Thy cruelty in execution Upon offenders, hath exceeded law, And left thee to the mercy of the law. They sale of offices and towns in France, If they were known, as the suspect is great, Would make thee quickly hop without thy head. Exit GLOUCESTER. QUEEN MARGARET drops her fan Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not? She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear I cry you mercy, madam, was it you? Was't I! yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman: Could I come near your beauty with my nails, I'd set my ten commandments in your face. Sweet aunt, be quiet, 'twas against her will. Against her will! good king, look to't in time, She'll hamper thee, and dandle thee like a baby: Though in this place most master wear no breeches, She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged. Exit Lord cardinal, I will follow Eleanor, And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds: She's tickled now, her fume needs no spurs, She'll gallop far enough to her destruction. Exit Re-enter GLOUCESTER Now, lords, my choler being over-blown With walking once about the quadrangle, I come to talk of commonwealth affairs. As for your spiteful false objections, Prove them, and I lie open to the law: But God in mercy so deal with my soul, As I in duty love my king and country! But, to the matter that we have in hand: I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man To be your regent in the realm of France. Before we make election, give me leave To show some reason, of no little force, That York is most unmeet of any man. I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:",Human
"First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride, Next, if I be appointed for the place, My Lord of Somerset will keep me here, Without discharge, money, or furniture, Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands: Last time, I danced attendance on his will Till Paris was besieged, famish'd, and lost. That can I witness, and a fouler fact Did never traitor in the land commit. Peace, headstrong Warwick! Image of pride, why should I hold my peace? Enter HORNER, the Armourer, and his man PETER, guarded Because here is a man accused of treason: Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself! Doth any one accuse York for a traitor? What mean'st thou, Suffolk, tell me, what are these? Please it your majesty, this is the man That doth accuse his master of high treason: His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York, Was rightful heir unto the English crown And that your majesty was a usurper. Say, man, were these thy words? An't shall please your majesty, I never said nor thought any such matter: God is my witness, I am falsely accused by the villain. By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my Lord of York's armour. Base dunghill villain and mechanical, I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech. I do beseech your royal majesty, Let him have all the rigor of the law. Alas, my lord, hang me, if ever I spake the words. My accuser is my 'prentice, and when I did correct him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his knees he would be even with me: I have good witness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty, do not cast away an honest man for a villain's accusation. Uncle, what shall we say to this in law? This doom, my lord, if I may judge: Let Somerset be regent over the French, Because in York this breeds suspicion: And let these have a day appointed them For single combat in convenient place, For he hath witness of his servant's malice: This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.

No marvel, an it like your majesty, My lord protector's hawks do tower so well, They know their master loves to be aloft, And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.

[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Are ye advised? the east side of the grove? [Aside to CARDINAL]  Cardinal, I am with you. Why, how now, uncle Gloucester! Talking of hawking, nothing else, my lord. Aside to CARDINAL Now, by God's mother, priest, I'll shave your crown for this, Or all my fence shall fail. [Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Medice, teipsum-- Protector, see to't well, protect yourself. The winds grow high, so do your stomachs, lords. How irksome is this music to my heart! When such strings jar, what hope of harmony? I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife. Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban's, crying 'A miracle!' What means this noise? Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim? A miracle! a miracle! Come to the king and tell him what miracle. Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine, Within this half-hour, hath received his sight, A man that ne'er saw in his life before. Now, God be praised, that to believing souls Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair! Enter the Mayor of Saint Alban's and his  brethren, bearing SIMPCOX, between two in a chair, SIMPCOX's Wife following Here comes the townsmen on procession, To present your highness with the man. Great is his comfort in this earthly vale, Although by his sight his sin be multiplied. Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king, His highness' pleasure is to talk with him. Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance, That we for thee may glorify the Lord. What, hast thou been long blind and now restored? Born blind, an't please your grace. Ay, indeed, was he. What woman is this?",Human
"His wife, an't like your worship. Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have better told. Where wert thou born? At Berwick in the north, an't like your grace. Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee: Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass, But still remember what the Lord hath done. Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance, Or of devotion, to this holy shrine? God knows, of pure devotion, being call'd A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep, By good Saint Alban, who said, 'Simpcox, come, Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.' Most true, forsooth, and many time and oft Myself have heard a voice to call him so. What, art thou lame? Ay, God Almighty help me! How camest thou so? A fall off of a tree. A plum-tree, master. How long hast thou been blind? Born so, master. What, and wouldst climb a tree? But that in all my life, when I was a youth. Too true, and bought his climbing very dear. Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst venture so. Alas,  good master, my wife desired some damsons, And made me climb, with danger of my life. A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve. Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them: In my opinion yet thou seest not well. Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban. Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of? Red, master, red as blood. Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of? Black, forsooth: coal-black as jet. Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of? And yet, I think, jet did he never see. But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many. Never, before this day, in all his life. Tell me, sirrah, what's my name? Alas, master, I know not. What's his name? I know not. Nor his? No, indeed, master. What's thine own name?",Human
"Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master. Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou mightest as well have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we do wear. Sight may distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here hath done a miracle, and would ye not think his cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple to his legs again? O master, that you could! My masters of Saint Alban's, have you not beadles in your town, and things called whips? Yes, my lord, if it please your grace. Then send for one presently. Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight. Exit an Attendant Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. Now, sirrah, if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me over this stool and run away. Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone: You go about to torture me in vain. Enter a Beadle with whips Well, sir, we must have you find your legs. Sirrah beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool. I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah, off with your doublet quickly. Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand. After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over the stool and runs away, and they follow and cry, 'A miracle!' O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long? It made me laugh to see the villain run. Follow the knave, and take this drab away. Alas, sir, we did it for pure need. Let them be whipped through every market-town, till they come to Berwick, from whence they came. Exeunt Wife, Beadle, Mayor,  and c Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day. True, made the lame to leap and fly away. But you have done more miracles than I, You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly. Enter BUCKINGHAM What tidings with our cousin Buckingham? Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold. A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent, Under the countenance and confederacy Of Lady Eleanor, the protector's wife, The ringleader and head of all this rout, Have practised dangerously against your state, Dealing with witches and with conjurers: Whom we have apprehended in the fact,",Human
"Raising up wicked spirits from under ground, Demanding of King Henry's life and death, And other of your highness' privy-council, As more at large your grace shall understand. [Aside to GLOUCESTER]  And so, my lord protector, by this means Your lady is forthcoming yet at London. This news, I think, hath turn'd your weapon's edge, 'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour. Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart: Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers, And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to thee, Or to the meanest groom. O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones, Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby! Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest. And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best. Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal, How I have loved my king and commonweal: And, for my wife, I know not how it stands, Sorry I am to hear what I have heard: Noble she is, but if she have forgot Honour and virtue and conversed with such As, like to pitch, defile nobility, I banish her my bed and company And give her as a prey to law and shame, That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name. Well, for this night we will repose us here: To-morrow toward London back again, To look into this business thoroughly And call these foul offenders to their answers And poise the cause in justice' equal scales, Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails. Flourish. Exeunt SCENE II. London. YORK'S garden. Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick, Our simple supper ended, give me leave In this close walk to satisfy myself, In craving your opinion of my title, Which is infallible, to England's crown. My lord, I long to hear it at full. Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good, The Nevils are thy subjects to command. Then thus: Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons: The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales, The second, William of Hatfield, and the third, Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster,",Human
"The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York, The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, William of Windsor was the seventh and last. Edward the Black Prince died before his father And left behind him Richard, his only son, Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king, Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt, Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth, Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king, Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came, And him to Pomfret, where, as all you know, Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously. Father, the duke hath told the truth: Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown. Which now they hold by force and not by right, For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead, The issue of the next son should have reign'd. But William of Hatfield died without an heir. The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter, Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March: Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March, Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor. This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke, As I have read, laid claim unto the crown, And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king, Who kept him in captivity till he died. But to the rest. His eldest sister, Anne, My mother, being heir unto the crown Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was son To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son. By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir To Roger Earl of March, who was the son Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe, Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence: So, if the issue of the elder son Succeed before the younger, I am king. What plain proceeding is more plain than this? Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt, The fourth son, York claims it from the third. Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign: It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock. Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together, And in this private plot be we the first That shall salute our rightful sovereign With honour of his birthright to the crown. Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!",Human
"We thank you, lords. But I am not your king Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster, And that's not suddenly to be perform'd, But with advice and silent secrecy. Do you as I do in these dangerous days: Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence, At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition, At Buckingham and all the crew of them, Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock, That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey: 'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy. My lord, break we off, we know your mind at full. My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick Shall one day make the Duke of York a king. And, Nevil, this I do assure myself: Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick The greatest man in England but the king. Exeunt SCENE III. A hall of justice. Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN  MARGARET, GLOUCESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK, and SALISBURY,  the DUCHESS, MARGARET JOURDAIN, SOUTHWELL, HUME, and BOLINGBROKE, under guard Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife: In sight of God and us, your guilt is great: Receive the sentence of the law for sins Such as by God's book are adjudged to death. You four, from hence to prison back again, From thence unto the place of execution: The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes, And you three shall be strangled on the gallows. You, madam, for you are more nobly born, Despoiled of your honour in your life, Shall, after three days' open penance done, Live in your country here in banishment, With Sir John Stanley, in the Isle of Man. Welcome is banishment, welcome were my death. Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee: I cannot justify whom the law condemns. Exeunt DUCHESS and other prisoners, guarded Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief. Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground! I beseech your majesty, give me leave to go, Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease. Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester: ere thou go, Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself Protector be, and God shall be my hope, My stay, my guide and lantern to my feet: And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved Than when thou wert protector to thy King.",Human
"I see no reason why a king of years Should be to be protected like a child. God and King Henry govern England's realm. Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm. My staff? here, noble Henry, is my staff: As willingly do I the same resign As e'er thy father Henry made it mine, And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it As others would ambitiously receive it. Farewell, good king: when I am dead and gone, May honourable peace attend thy throne! Exit Why, now is Henry king, and Margaret queen, And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself, That bears so shrewd a maim, two pulls at once, His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off. This staff of honour raught, there let it stand Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand. Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays, Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days. Lords, let him go.

I pray God! for I am never able to deal with my master, he hath learnt me so much fence already.",Human
"Come, leave your drinking, and fall to blows. Sirrah, what's thy name? Peter, forsooth. Peter! what more? Thump. Thump! then see thou thump thy master well. Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man's instigation, to prove him a knave and myself an honest man: and touching the Duke of York, I will take my death, I never meant him any ill, nor the king, nor the queen: and therefore, Peter, have at thee with a downright blow! Dispatch: this knave's tongue begins to double. Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants! Alarum. They fight, and PETER strikes him down Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason. Dies Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God, and the good wine in thy master's way. O God, have I overcome mine enemy in this presence? O Peter, thou hast prevailed in right! Go, take hence that traitor from our sight, For his death we do perceive his guilt: And God in justice hath revealed to us The truth and innocence of this poor fellow, Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully. Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward. Sound a flourish. Exeunt SCENE IV. A street. Enter GLOUCESTER and his Servingmen, in mourning cloaks Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud, And after summer evermore succeeds Barren winter, with his wrathful nipping cold: So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet. Sirs, what's o'clock? Ten, my lord. Ten is the hour that was appointed me To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess: Uneath may she endure the flinty streets, To tread them with her tender-feeling feet. Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook The abject people gazing on thy face, With envious looks, laughing at thy shame, That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets. But, soft! I think she comes, and I'll prepare My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries. Enter the DUCHESS in a white sheet, and a taper  burning in her hand, with STANLEY, the Sheriff, and Officers So please your grace, we'll take her from the sheriff. No, stir not, for your lives, let her pass by.",Human
"Come you, my lord, to see my open shame? Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze! See how the giddy multitude do point, And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee! Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks, And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame, And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine! Be patient, gentle Nell, forget this grief. Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself! For whilst I think I am thy married wife And thou a prince, protector of this land, Methinks I should not thus be led along, Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back, And followed with a rabble that rejoice To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans. The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet, And when I start, the envious people laugh And bid me be advised how I tread. Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke? Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world, Or count them happy that enjoy the sun? No, dark shall be my light and night my day, To think upon my pomp shall be my hell. Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife, And he a prince and ruler of the land: Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess, Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock To every idle rascal follower. But be thou mild and blush not at my shame, Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will, For Suffolk, he that can do all in all With her that hateth thee and hates us all, And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest, Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings, And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee: But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared, Nor never seek prevention of thy foes. Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry, I must offend before I be attainted, And had I twenty times so many foes, And each of them had twenty times their power, All these could not procure me any scathe, So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless. Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach? Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away But I in danger for the breach of law. Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell: I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience,",Human
"These few days' wonder will be quickly worn. Enter a Herald I summon your grace to his majesty's parliament, Holden at Bury the first of this next month. And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before! This is close dealing. Well, I will be there. Exit Herald My Nell, I take my leave: and, master sheriff, Let not her penance exceed the king's commission. An't please your grace, here my commission stays, And Sir John Stanley is appointed now To take her with him to the Isle of Man. Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here? So am I given in charge, may't please your grace. Entreat her not the worse in that I pray You use her well: the world may laugh again, And I may live to do you kindness if You do it her: and so, Sir John, farewell!

For none abides with me: my joy is death, Death, at whose name I oft have been afear'd, Because I wish'd this world's eternity. Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence, I care not whither, for I beg no favour, Only convey me where thou art commanded. Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man, There to be used according to your state. That's bad enough, for I am but reproach: And shall I then be used reproachfully? Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey's lady, According to that state you shall be used. Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare, Although thou hast been conduct of my shame. It is my office, and, madam, pardon me. Ay, ay, farewell, thy office is discharged. Come, Stanley, shall we go?

"'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man, Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now. Can you not see? or will ye not observe The strangeness of his alter'd countenance? With what a majesty he bears himself, How insolent of late he is become, How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself? We know the time since he was mild and affable, And if we did but glance a far-off look, Immediately he was upon his knee, That all the court admired him for submission: But meet him now, and, be it in the morn, When every one will give the time of day, He knits his brow and shows an angry eye, And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee, Disdaining duty that to us belongs. Small curs are not regarded when they grin, But great men tremble when the lion roars, And Humphrey is no little man in England. First note that he is near you in descent, And should you fall, he as the next will mount. Me seemeth then it is no policy, Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears And his advantage following your decease, That he should come about your royal person Or be admitted to your highness' council. By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts, And when he please to make commotion, 'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him. Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted, Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden And choke the herbs for want of husbandry. The reverent care I bear unto my lord Made me collect these dangers in the duke. If it be fond, call it a woman's fear, Which fear if better reasons can supplant, I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke. My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York, Reprove my allegation, if you can, Or else conclude my words effectual. Well hath your highness seen into this duke, And, had I first been put to speak my mind, I think I should have told your grace's tale. The duchess, by his subornation, Upon my life, began her devilish practises: Or, if he were not privy to those faults, Yet, by reputing of his high descent, As next the king he was successive heir, And such high vaunts of his nobility, Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess",Human
"By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall. Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep, And in his simple show he harbours treason. The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb. No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit. Did he not, contrary to form of law, Devise strange deaths for small offences done? And did he not, in his protectorship, Levy great sums of money through the realm For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it? By means whereof the towns each day revolted. Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown. Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey. My lords, at once: the care you have of us, To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot, Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience, Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent From meaning treason to our royal person As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove: The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given To dream on evil or to work my downfall. Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance! Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed, For he's disposed as the hateful raven: Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him, For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf. Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit? Take heed, my lord, the welfare of us all Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man. Enter SOMERSET All health unto my gracious sovereign! Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France? That all your interest in those territories Is utterly bereft you, all is lost. Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!

Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud And caterpillars eat my leaves away, But I will remedy this gear ere long, Or sell my title for a glorious grave. Enter GLOUCESTER All happiness unto my lord the king! Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long. Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon, Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art: I do arrest thee of high treason here. Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush",Human
"Nor change my countenance for this arrest: A heart unspotted is not easily daunted. The purest spring is not so free from mud As I am clear from treason to my sovereign: Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty? 'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France, And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay, By means whereof his highness hath lost France. Is it but thought so? what are they that think it? I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay, Nor ever had one penny bribe from France. So help me God, as I have watch'd the night, Ay, night by night, in studying good for England, That doit that e'er I wrested from the king, Or any groat I hoarded to my use, Be brought against me at my trial-day! No, many a pound of mine own proper store, Because I would not tax the needy commons, Have I disbursed to the garrisons, And never ask'd for restitution. It serves you well, my lord, to say so much. I say no more than truth, so help me God! In your protectorship you did devise Strange tortures for offenders never heard of, That England was defamed by tyranny. Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was protector, Pity was all the fault that was in me, For I should melt at an offender's tears, And lowly words were ransom for their fault. Unless it were a bloody murderer, Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers, I never gave them condign punishment: Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured Above the felon or what trespass else. My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered: But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge, Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself. I do arrest you in his highness' name, And here commit you to my lord cardinal To keep, until your further time of trial. My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope That you will clear yourself from all suspect: My conscience tells me you are innocent. Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous: Virtue is choked with foul ambition And charity chased hence by rancour's hand, Foul subornation is predominant And equity exiled your highness' land. I know their complot is to have my life,",Human
"And if my death might make this island happy, And prove the period of their tyranny, I would expend it with all willingness: But mine is made the prologue to their play, For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril, Will not conclude their plotted tragedy. Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice, And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate, Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue The envious load that lies upon his heart, And dogged York, that reaches at the moon, Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back, By false accuse doth level at my life: And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest, Causeless have laid disgraces on my head, And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up My liefest liege to be mine enemy: Ay, all you have laid your heads together-- Myself had notice of your conventicles-- And all to make away my guiltless life. I shall not want false witness to condemn me, Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt, The ancient proverb will be well effected: 'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.' My liege, his railing is intolerable: If those that care to keep your royal person From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at, And the offender granted scope of speech, 'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace. Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd, As if she had suborned some to swear False allegations to o'erthrow his state?

What louring star now envies thy estate, That these great lords and Margaret our queen Do seek subversion of thy harmless life? Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong, And as the butcher takes away the calf And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays, Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house, Even so remorseless have they borne him hence, And as the dam runs lowing up and down, Looking the way her harmless young one went, And can do nought but wail her darling's loss, Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes Look after him and cannot do him good, So mighty are his vowed enemies.

Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I-- And yet herein I judge mine own wit good-- This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world, To rid us of the fear we have of him. That he should die is worthy policy, But yet we want a colour for his death: 'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law. But, in my mind, that were no policy: The king will labour still to save his life, The commons haply rise, to save his life, And yet we have but trivial argument, More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death. So that, by this, you would not have him die. Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I! 'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.",Human

So the poor chicken should be sure of death. Madam, 'tis true, and were't not madness, then, To make the fox surveyor of the fold? Who being accused a crafty murderer, His guilt should be but idly posted over, Because his purpose is not executed. No, let him die, in that he is a fox, By nature proved an enemy to the flock, Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood, As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege. And do not stand on quillets how to slay him: Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety, Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how, So he be dead, for that is good deceit Which mates him first that first intends deceit. Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke. Not resolute, except so much were done, For things are often spoke and seldom meant: But that my heart accordeth with my tongue, Seeing the deed is meritorious, And to preserve my sovereign from his foe, Say but the word, and I will be his priest. But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk, Ere you can take due orders for a priest: Say you consent and censure well the deed, And I'll provide his executioner, I tender so the safety of my liege. Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing. And so say I. And I    and now we three have spoke it, It skills not greatly who impugns our doom. Enter a Post Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain, To signify that rebels there are up And put the Englishmen unto the sword: Send succors, lords, and stop the rage betime, Before the wound do grow uncurable, For, being green, there is great hope of help. A breach that craves a quick expedient stop! What counsel give you in this weighty cause? That Somerset be sent as regent thither: 'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd, Witness the fortune he hath had in France. If York, with all his far-fet policy, Had been the regent there instead of me,",Human
"He never would have stay'd in France so long. No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done: I rather would have lost my life betimes Than bring a burthen of dishonour home By staying there so long till all were lost. Show me one scar character'd on thy skin: Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win. Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire, If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with: No more, good York, sweet Somerset, be still: Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there, Might happily have proved far worse than his. What, worse than nought? nay, then, a shame take all! And, in the number, thee that wishest shame! My Lord of York, try what your fortune is. The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms And temper clay with blood of Englishmen: To Ireland will you lead a band of men, Collected choicely, from each county some, And try your hap against the Irishmen? I will, my lord, so please his majesty. Why, our authority is his consent, And what we do establish he confirms: Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand. I am content: provide me soldiers, lords, Whiles I take order for mine own affairs. A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd. But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey. No more of him, for I will deal with him That henceforth he shall trouble us no more. And so break off, the day is almost spent: Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event. My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days At Bristol I expect my soldiers, For there I'll ship them all for Ireland. I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York. Exeunt all but YORK Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts, And change misdoubt to resolution: Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art Resign to death, it is not worth the enjoying: Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man, And find no harbour in a royal heart. Faster than spring-time showers comes thought on thought, And not a thought but thinks on dignity. My brain more busy than the labouring spider Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies. Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done, To send me packing with an host of men:",Human
"I fear me you but warm the starved snake, Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting your hearts. 'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me: I take it kindly, and yet be well assured You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands. Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band, I will stir up in England some black storm Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell, And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage Until the golden circuit on my head, Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams, Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw. And, for a minister of my intent, I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman, John Cade of Ashford, To make commotion, as full well he can, Under the title of John Mortimer. In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade Oppose himself against a troop of kerns, And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine, And, in the end being rescued, I have seen Him caper upright like a wild Morisco, Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells. Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern, Hath he conversed with the enemy, And undiscover'd come to me again And given me notice of their villanies. This devil here shall be my substitute, For that John Mortimer, which now is dead, In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble: By this I shall perceive the commons' mind, How they affect the house and claim of York. Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured, I know no pain they can inflict upon him Will make him say I moved him to those arms. Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will, Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd, For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be, And Henry put apart, the next for me.

What have we done? Didst ever hear a man so penitent? Enter SUFFOLK",Human
"Here comes my lord. Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing? Ay, my good lord, he's dead. Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house, I will reward you for this venturous deed. The king and all the peers are here at hand. Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well, According as I gave directions? 'Tis, my good lord. Away! be gone. Exeunt Murderers Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SOMERSET, with Attendants Go, call our uncle to our presence straight, Say we intend to try his grace to-day. If he be guilty, as 'tis published. I'll call him presently, my noble lord. Exit Lords, take your places, and, I pray you all, Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester Than from true evidence of good esteem He be approved in practise culpable. God forbid any malice should prevail, That faultless may condemn a nobleman! Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion! I thank thee, Meg, these words content me much. Re-enter SUFFOLK How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou? Where is our uncle? what's the matter, Suffolk? Dead in his bed, my lord, Gloucester is dead. Marry, God forfend! God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night The duke was dumb and could not speak a word. KING HENRY VI swoons How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead. Rear up his body, wring him by the nose. Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes! He doth revive again: madam, be patient. O heavenly God! How fares my gracious lord? Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry, comfort! What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me? Came he right now to sing a raven's note, Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers, And thinks he that the chirping of a wren, By crying comfort from a hollow breast, Can chase away the first-conceived sound? Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words, Lay not thy hands on me, forbear, I say, Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting. Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!",Human
"Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world. Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding: Yet do not go away: come, basilisk, And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight, For in the shade of death I shall find joy, In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead. Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus? Although the duke was enemy to him, Yet he most Christian-like laments his death: And for myself, foe as he was to me, Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life, I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans, Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs, And all to have the noble duke alive. What know I how the world may deem of me? For it is known we were but hollow friends: It may be judged I made the duke away, So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded, And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach. This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy! To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy! Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man! Be woe for me, more wretched than he is. What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face? I am no loathsome leper, look on me. What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf? Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen. Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb? Why, then, dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy. Erect his statue and worship it, And make my image but an alehouse sign. Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea And twice by awkward wind from England's bank Drove back again unto my native clime? What boded this, but well forewarning wind Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest, Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'? What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves: And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore, Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock Yet AEolus would not be a murderer, But left that hateful office unto thee: The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me, Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore, With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness: The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands And would not dash me with their ragged sides,",Human
"Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they, Might in thy palace perish Margaret. As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs, When from thy shore the tempest beat us back, I stood upon the hatches in the storm, And when the dusky sky began to rob My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view, I took a costly jewel from my neck, A heart it was, bound in with diamonds, And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it, And so I wish'd thy body might my heart: And even with this I lost fair England's view And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles, For losing ken of Albion's wished coast. How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue, The agent of thy foul inconstancy, To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did When he to madding Dido would unfold His father's acts commenced in burning Troy! Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him? Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret! For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long. Noise within. Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY, and many Commons It is reported, mighty sovereign, That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means. The commons, like an angry hive of bees That want their leader, scatter up and down And care not who they sting in his revenge. Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny, Until they hear the order of his death. That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true, But how he died God knows, not Henry: Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse, And comment then upon his sudden death. That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury, With the rude multitude till I return. Exit O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts, My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life! If my suspect be false, forgive me, God, For judgment only doth belong to thee. Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain Upon his face an ocean of salt tears, To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk, And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling: But all in vain are these mean obsequies,",Human
"And to survey his dead and earthly image, What were it but to make my sorrow greater? Re-enter WARWICK and others, bearing GLOUCESTER'S body on a bed Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body. That is to see how deep my grave is made, For with his soul fled all my worldly solace, For seeing him I see my life in death. As surely as my soul intends to live With that dread King that took our state upon him To free us from his father's wrathful curse, I do believe that violent hands were laid Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke. A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue! What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow? See how the blood is settled in his face. Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost, Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless, Being all descended to the labouring heart, Who, in the conflict that it holds with death, Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy, Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth To blush and beautify the cheek again. But see, his face is black and full of blood, His eye-balls further out than when he lived, Staring full ghastly like a strangled man, His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling, His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued: Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking, His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged, Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged. It cannot be but he was murder'd here, The least of all these signs were probable. Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death? Myself and Beaufort had him in protection, And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers. But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes, And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep: 'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend, And 'tis well seen he found an enemy. Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death. Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh And sees fast by a butcher with an axe, But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter? Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest, But may imagine how the bird was dead, Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak? Even so suspicious is this tragedy. Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?",Human
"Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons? I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men, But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease, That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart That slanders me with murder's crimson badge. Say, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire, That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death. Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him? He dares not calm his contumelious spirit Nor cease to be an arrogant controller, Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times. Madam, be still, with reverence may I say, For every word you speak in his behalf Is slander to your royal dignity. Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor! If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much, Thy mother took into her blameful bed Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock Was graft with crab-tree slip, whose fruit thou art, And never of the Nevils' noble race. But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee And I should rob the deathsman of his fee, Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames, And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild, I would, false murderous coward, on thy knee Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech, And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st That thou thyself was born in bastardy, And after all this fearful homage done, Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell, Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men! Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood, If from this presence thou darest go with me. Away even now, or I will drag thee hence: Unworthy though thou art, I'll cope with thee And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.

Dread lord, the commons send you word by me, Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death, Or banished fair England's territories, They will by violence tear him from your palace And torture him with grievous lingering death. They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died, They say, in him they fear your highness' death, And mere instinct of love and loyalty, Free from a stubborn opposite intent, As being thought to contradict your liking, Makes them thus forward in his banishment. They say, in care of your most royal person, That if your highness should intend to sleep And charge that no man should disturb your rest In pain of your dislike or pain of death, Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict, Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue, That slily glided towards your majesty, It were but necessary you were waked, Lest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber, The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal, And therefore do they cry, though you forbid, That they will guard you, whether you will or no, From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is, With whose envenomed and fatal sting, Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth, They say, is shamefully bereft of life. [Within]  An answer from the king, my Lord of Salisbury!

A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them? Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan, I would invent as bitter-searching terms, As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear, Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth, With full as many signs of deadly hate, As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave: My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words, Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint, Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract, Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban: And even now my burthen'd heart would break, Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink! Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste! Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees! Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks! Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting! Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss, And boding screech-owls make the concert full!

Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not: Never yet did base dishonour blur our name, But with our sword we wiped away the blot, Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge, Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced, And I proclaim'd a coward through the world! Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince, The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole. The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags! Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke: Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I? But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be. Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood, The honourable blood of Lancaster, Must not be shed by such a jaded groom. Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?

By devilish policy art thou grown great, And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart. By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France, The false revolting Normans thorough thee Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts, And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.

I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it. So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up. O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men. The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons. Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen. True, and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation, which is as much to say as, let the magistrates be labouring men, and therefore should we be magistrates. Thou hast hit it, for there's no better sign of a brave mind than a hard hand. I see them!

My father was a Mortimer,-- [Aside]  He was an honest man, and a good bricklayer. My mother a Plantagenet,-- [Aside]  I knew her well, she was a midwife. My wife descended of the Lacies,-- [Aside]  She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter, and sold many laces. [Aside]  But now of late, notable to travel with her furred pack, she washes bucks here at home. Therefore am I of an honourable house. [Aside]  Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable, and there was he borne, under a hedge, for his father had never a house but the cage. Valiant I am. [Aside]  A' must needs, for beggary is valiant. I am able to endure much. [Aside]  No question of that, for I have seen him whipped three market-days together. I fear neither sword nor fire. [Aside]  He need not fear the sword, for his coat is of proof. [Aside]  But methinks he should stand in fear of fire, being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep. Be brave, then, for your captain is brave, and vows reformation. There shall be in England seven halfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the three-hooped pot, shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony to drink small beer: all the realm shall be in common, and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to grass: and when I am king, as king I will be,-- God save your majesty! I thank you, good people: there shall be no money, all shall eat and drink on my score, and I will apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree like brothers and worship me their lord.

As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not: It is to you, good people, that I speak, Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign, For I am rightful heir unto the crown. Villain, thy father was a plasterer, And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not? And Adam was a gardener. And what of that? Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March. Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter, did he not? Ay, sir. By her he had two children at one birth. That's false. Ay, there's the question, but I say, 'tis true: The elder of them, being put to nurse, Was by a beggar-woman stolen away, And, ignorant of his birth and parentage, Became a bricklayer when he came to age: His son am I, deny it, if you can. Nay, 'tis too true, therefore he shall be king. Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it, therefore deny it not. And will you credit this base drudge's words, That speaks he knows not what? Ay, marry, will we, therefore get ye gone. Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this. [Aside]  He lies, for I invented it myself. Go to, sirrah, tell the king from me, that, for his father's sake, Henry the Fifth, in whose time boys went to span-counter for French crowns, I am content he shall reign, but I'll be protector over him. And furthermore, well have the Lord Say's head for selling the dukedom of Maine. And good reason, for thereby is England mained, and fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch: and more than that, he can speak French, and therefore he is a traitor. O gross and miserable ignorance! Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are our enemies, go to, then, I ask but this: can he that speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good counsellor, or no? No, no, and therefore we'll have his head. Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail, Assail them with the army of the king. Herald, away, and throughout every town",Human

Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school, and whereas, before, our forefathers had no other books but the score and the tally, thou hast caused printing to be used, and, contrary to the king, his crown and dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed justices of peace, to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer. Moreover, thou hast put them in prison, and because they could not read, thou hast hanged them, when, indeed, only for that cause they have been most worthy to live.

Wherefore, on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet' was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown bill, and many a time, when I have been dry and bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a quart pot to drink in, and now the word 'sallet' must serve me to feed on.

Look on me well: I have eat no meat these five days, yet, come thou and thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.

The cause why I have brought this army hither Is to remove proud Somerset from the king, Seditious to his grace and to the state. That is too much presumption on thy part: But if thy arms be to no other end, The king hath yielded unto thy demand: The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower. Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?

The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou! O, let me view his visage, being dead, That living wrought me such exceeding trouble. Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him? I was, an't like your majesty. How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree? Alexander Iden, that's my name, A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king. So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss He were created knight for his good service. Iden, kneel down. He kneels Rise up a knight. We give thee for reward a thousand marks, And will that thou henceforth attend on us. May Iden live to merit such a bounty. And never live but true unto his liege!

For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head, But boldly stand and front him to his face. How now! is Somerset at liberty? Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts, And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart. Shall I endure the sight of Somerset? False king! why hast thou broken faith with me, Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse? King did I call thee? no, thou art not king, Not fit to govern and rule multitudes, Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor. That head of thine doth not become a crown, Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff, And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.",Human

This is my king, York, I do not mistake, But thou mistakest me much to think I do: To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad? Ay, Clifford, a bedlam and ambitious humour Makes him oppose himself against his king. He is a traitor, let him to the Tower, And chop away that factious pate of his. He is arrested, but will not obey, His sons, he says, shall give their words for him. Will you not, sons? Ay, noble father, if our words will serve. And if words will not, then our weapons shall.

Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump, As crooked in thy manners as thy shape! Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon. Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves. Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow? Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair, Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son! What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian, And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles? O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty? If it be banish'd from the frosty head, Where shall it find a harbour in the earth? Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war, And shame thine honourable age with blood? Why art thou old, and want'st experience? Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it? For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me That bows unto the grave with mickle age. My lord, I have consider'd with myself The title of this most renowned duke, And in my conscience do repute his grace The rightful heir to England's royal seat. Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me? I have. Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath? It is great sin to swear unto a sin, But greater sin to keep a sinful oath. Who can be bound by any solemn vow To do a murderous deed, to rob a man, To force a spotless virgin's chastity, To reave the orphan of his patrimony, To wring the widow from her custom'd right, And have no other reason for this wrong But that he was bound by a solemn oath?

Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest, The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff, This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet, As on a mountain top the cedar shows That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm, Even to affright thee with the view thereof. And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear And tread it under foot with all contempt, Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear. And so to arms, victorious father, To quell the rebels and their complices. Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite, For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.

Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham, Is either slain or wounded dangerously, I cleft his beaver with a downright blow: That this is true, father, behold his blood.

They go up And when the king comes, offer no violence, Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce. The queen this day here holds her parliament, But little thinks we shall be of her council: By words or blows here let us win our right. Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house. The bloody parliament shall this be call'd, Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king, And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice Hath made us by-words to our enemies. Then leave me not, my lords, be resolute, I mean to take possession of my right.

Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father. And thine, Lord Clifford, and you both have vow'd revenge On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends. If I be not, heavens be revenged on me! The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel. What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down: My heart for anger burns, I cannot brook it. Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland. Patience is for poltroons, such as he: He durst not sit there, had your father lived. My gracious lord, here in the parliament Let us assail the family of York. Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so. Ah, know you not the city favours them, And they have troops of soldiers at their beck? But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.

For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York. 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was. Thy father was a traitor to the crown. Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown In following this usurping Henry. Whom should he follow but his natural king? True, Clifford, and that's Richard Duke of York. And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne? It must and shall be so: content thyself. Be Duke of Lancaster, let him be king. He is both king and Duke of Lancaster, And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget That we are those which chased you from the field And slew your fathers, and with colours spread March'd through the city to the palace gates. Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief, And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it. Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons, Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives Than drops of blood were in my father's veins. Urge it no more, lest that, instead of words, I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger As shall revenge his death before I stir. Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats! Will you we show our title to the crown? If not, our swords shall plead it in the field. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown? Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York, Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March: I am the son of Henry the Fifth, Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop And seized upon their towns and provinces. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all. The lord protector lost it, and not I: When I was crown'd I was but nine months old. You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose. Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head. Sweet father, do so, set it on your head. Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms, Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus. Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly. Sons, peace! Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak. Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords,",Human

No: first shall war unpeople this my realm, Ay, and their colours, often borne in France, And now in England to our heart's great sorrow, Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords? My title's good, and better far than his. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown. 'Twas by rebellion against his king. [Aside]  I know not what to say, my title's weak.-- Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir? What then? An if he may, then am I lawful king, For Richard, in the view of many lords, Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth, Whose heir my father was, and I am his. He rose against him, being his sovereign, And made him to resign his crown perforce. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd, Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown? No, for he could not so resign his crown But that the next heir should succeed and reign. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter? His is the right, and therefore pardon me. Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not? My conscience tells me he is lawful king. [Aside]  All will revolt from me, and turn to him. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st, Think not that Henry shall be so deposed. Deposed he shall be, in despite of all. Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power, Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent, Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud, Can set the duke up in despite of me. King Henry, be thy title right or wrong, Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence: May that ground gape and swallow me alive, Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father! O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart! Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown. What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?

Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid And never seen thee, never borne thee son, Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus? Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I, Or felt that pain which I did for him once, Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood, Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there, Rather than have that savage duke thine heir And disinherited thine only son. Father, you cannot disinherit me: If you be king, why should not I succeed? Pardon me, Margaret, pardon me, sweet son: The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me. Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced? I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch! Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me, And given unto the house of York such head As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance. To entail him and his heirs unto the crown, What is it, but to make thy sepulchre And creep into it far before thy time? Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais, Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas, The duke is made protector of the realm, And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds The trembling lamb environed with wolves.

About that which concerns your grace and us, The crown of England, father, which is yours. Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead. Your right depends not on his life or death. Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now: By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe, It will outrun you, father, in the end. I took an oath that he should quietly reign. But for a kingdom any oath may be broken: I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year. No, God forbid your grace should be forsworn. I shall be, if I claim by open war.

A short alarum within Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue, And I am faint and cannot fly their fury: And were I strong, I would not shun their fury: The sands are number'd that make up my life, Here must I stay, and here my life must end. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, PRINCE EDWARD, and Soldiers Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland, I dare your quenchless fury to more rage: I am your butt, and I abide your shot. Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet. Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm, With downright payment, show'd unto my father. Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car, And made an evening at the noontide prick. My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth A bird that will revenge upon you all: And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven, Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with. Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear? So cowards fight when they can fly no further, So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons,",Human
"So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives, Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers. O Clifford, but bethink thee once again, And in thy thought o'er-run my former time, And, if though canst for blushing, view this face, And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this! I will not bandy with thee word for word, But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one. Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes I would prolong awhile the traitor's life. Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland. Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart: What valour were it, when a cur doth grin, For one to thrust his hand between his teeth, When he might spurn him with his foot away? It is war's prize to take all vantages, And ten to one is no impeach of valour. They lay hands on YORK, who struggles Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin. So doth the cony struggle in the net. So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty, So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd. What would your grace have done unto him now? Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland, Come, make him stand upon this molehill here, That raught at mountains with outstretched arms, Yet parted but the shadow with his hand. What! was it you that would be England's king? Was't you that revell'd in our parliament, And made a preachment of your high descent? Where are your mess of sons to back you now? The wanton Edward, and the lusty George? And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy, Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies? Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland? Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point, Made issue from the bosom of the boy, And if thine eyes can water for his death, I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal. Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly, I should lament thy miserable state. I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York. What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death? Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad, And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.",Human
"Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance. Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport: York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown. A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him: Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on. Putting a paper crown on his head Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king! Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair, And this is he was his adopted heir. But how is it that great Plantagenet Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath? As I bethink me, you should not be king Till our King Henry had shook hands with death. And will you pale your head in Henry's glory, And rob his temples of the diadem, Now in his life, against your holy oath? O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable! Off with the crown, and with the crown his head, And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead. That is my office, for my father's sake. Nay, stay, lets hear the orisons he makes. She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France, Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth! How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex To triumph, like an Amazonian trull, Upon their woes whom fortune captivates! But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging, Made impudent with use of evil deeds, I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush. To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived, Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless. Thy father bears the type of King of Naples, Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem, Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman. Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult? It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen, Unless the adage must be verified, That beggars mounted run their horse to death. 'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud, But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small: 'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired, The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at: 'Tis government that makes them seem divine, The want thereof makes thee abominable: Thou art as opposite to every good As the Antipodes are unto us, Or as the south to the septentrion. O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide! How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child, To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,",Human
"And yet be seen to bear a woman's face? Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible, Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless. Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish: Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will: For raging wind blows up incessant showers, And when the rage allays, the rain begins. These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies: And every drop cries vengeance for his death, 'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false Frenchwoman. Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears. That face of his the hungry cannibals Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood: But you are more inhuman, more inexorable, O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania. See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears: This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy, And I with tears do wash the blood away. Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this: And if thou tell'st the heavy story right, Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears, Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears, And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!' There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse, And in thy need such comfort come to thee As now I reap at thy too cruel hand! Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world: My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads! Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin, I should not for my life but weep with him. To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul. What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland? Think but upon the wrong he did us all, And that will quickly dry thy melting tears. Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death. Stabbing him And here's to right our gentle-hearted king. Stabbing him Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God! My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee. Dies Off with his head, and set it on York gates, So York may overlook the town of York. Flourish. Exeunt ACT II SCENE I. A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire. A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,",Human
"Or whether he be 'scaped away or no From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit: Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news, Had he been slain, we should have heard the news, Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard The happy tidings of his good escape. How fares my brother? why is he so sad? I cannot joy, until I be resolved Where our right valiant father is become. I saw him in the battle range about, And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth. Methought he bore him in the thickest troop As doth a lion in a herd of neat, Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs, Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry, The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him. So fared our father with his enemies, So fled his enemies my warlike father: Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son. See how the morning opes her golden gates, And takes her farewell of the glorious sun! How well resembles it the prime of youth, Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love! Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns? Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun, Not separated with the racking clouds, But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky. See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss, As if they vow'd some league inviolable: Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun. In this the heaven figures some event. 'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of. I think it cites us, brother, to the field, That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet, Each one already blazing by our meeds, Should notwithstanding join our lights together And over-shine the earth as this the world. Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear Upon my target three fair-shining suns. Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it, You love the breeder better than the male. Enter a Messenger But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue? Ah, one that was a woful looker-on When as the noble Duke of York was slain, Your princely father and my loving lord! O, speak no more, for I have heard too much. Say how he died, for I will hear it all. Environed he was with many foes,",Human
"And stood against them, as the hope of Troy Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy. But Hercules himself must yield to odds, And many strokes, though with a little axe, Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak. By many hands your father was subdued, But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen, Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite, Laugh'd in his face, and when with grief he wept, The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks A napkin steeped in the harmless blood Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain: And after many scorns, many foul taunts, They took his head, and on the gates of York They set the same, and there it doth remain, The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd. Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon, Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay. O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain The flower of Europe for his chivalry, And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him, For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee. Now my soul's palace is become a prison: Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body Might in the ground be closed up in rest! For never henceforth shall I joy again, Never, O never shall I see more joy! I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart: Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen, For selfsame wind that I should speak withal Is kindling coals that fires all my breast, And burns me up with flames that tears would quench. To weep is to make less the depth of grief: Tears then for babes, blows and revenge for me Richard, I bear thy name, I'll venge thy death, Or die renowned by attempting it. His name that valiant duke hath left with thee, His dukedom and his chair with me is left. Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird, Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun: For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say, Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his. March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad? Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told, The words would add more anguish than the wounds.",Human
"O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain! O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet, Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption, Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death. Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears, And now, to add more measure to your woes, I come to tell you things sith then befall'n. After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought, Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp, Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run, Were brought me of your loss and his depart. I, then in London keeper of the king, Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends, And very well appointed, as I thought, March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen, Bearing the king in my behalf along, For by my scouts I was advertised That she was coming with a full intent To dash our late decree in parliament Touching King Henry's oath and your succession. Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought: But whether 'twas the coldness of the king, Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen, That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen, Or whether 'twas report of her success, Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour, Who thunders to his captives blood and death, I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth, Their weapons like to lightning came and went, Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight, Or like an idle thresher with a flail, Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends. I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause, With promise of high pay and great rewards: But all in vain, they had no heart to fight, And we in them no hope to win the day, So that we fled, the king unto the queen, Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself, In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you: For in the marches here we heard you were, Making another head to fight again. Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick? And when came George from Burgundy to England? Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers, And for your brother, he was lately sent From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy, With aid of soldiers to this needful war. 'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled: Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,",Human
"But ne'er till now his scandal of retire. Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear, For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head, And wring the awful sceptre from his fist, Were he as famous and as bold in war As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer. I know it well, Lord Warwick, blame me not: 'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak. But in this troublous time what's to be done? Shall we go throw away our coats of steel, And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns, Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads? Or shall we on the helmets of our foes Tell our devotion with revengeful arms? If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords. Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out, And therefore comes my brother Montague. Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen, With Clifford and the haught Northumberland, And of their feather many more proud birds, Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax. He swore consent to your succession, His oath enrolled in the parliament, And now to London all the crew are gone, To frustrate both his oath and what beside May make against the house of Lancaster. Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong: Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself, With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March, Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure, Will but amount to five and twenty thousand, Why, Via! to London will we march amain, And once again bestride our foaming steeds, And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!' But never once again turn back and fly. Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak: Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day, That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay. Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean, And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!-- Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend! No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York: The next degree is England's royal throne, For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd In every borough as we pass along, And he that throws not up his cap for joy Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head. King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague, Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,",Human
"But sound the trumpets, and about our task. Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel, As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds, I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine. Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us! Enter a Messenger How now! what news? The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me, The queen is coming with a puissant host, And craves your company for speedy counsel. Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away. Exeunt SCENE II. Before York. Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET,  PRINCE EDWARD, CLIFFORD, and NORTHUMBERLAND, with drum and trumpets Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York. Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy That sought to be encompass'd with your crown: Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord? Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck: To see this sight, it irks my very soul. Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault, Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow. My gracious liege, this too much lenity And harmful pity must be laid aside. To whom do lions cast their gentle looks? Not to the beast that would usurp their den. Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick? Not his that spoils her young before her face. Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting? Not he that sets his foot upon her back. The smallest worm will turn being trodden on, And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood. Ambitious York doth level at thy crown, Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows: He, but a duke, would have his son a king, And raise his issue, like a loving sire, Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son, Didst yield consent to disinherit him, Which argued thee a most unloving father. Unreasonable creatures feed their young, And though man's face be fearful to their eyes, Yet, in protection of their tender ones, Who hath not seen them, even with those wings Which sometime they have used with fearful flight, Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest, Offer their own lives in their young's defence? For shame, my liege, make them your precedent! Were it not pity that this goodly boy Should lose his birthright by his father's fault, And long hereafter say unto his child,",Human
"'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got My careless father fondly gave away'? Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy, And let his manly face, which promiseth Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart To hold thine own and leave thine own with him. Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator, Inferring arguments of mighty force. But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear That things ill-got had ever bad success? And happy always was it for that son Whose father for his hoarding went to hell? I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind, And would my father had left me no more! For all the rest is held at such a rate As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep Than in possession and jot of pleasure. Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know How it doth grieve me that thy head is here! My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh, And this soft courage makes your followers faint. You promised knighthood to our forward son: Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently. Edward, kneel down. Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight, And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right. My gracious father, by your kingly leave, I'll draw it as apparent to the crown, And in that quarrel use it to the death. Why, that is spoken like a toward prince. Enter a Messenger Royal commanders, be in readiness: For with a band of thirty thousand men Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York, And in the towns, as they do march along, Proclaims him king, and many fly to him: Darraign your battle, for they are at hand. I would your highness would depart the field: The queen hath best success when you are absent. Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune. Why, that's my fortune too, therefore I'll stay. Be it with resolution then to fight. My royal father, cheer these noble lords And hearten those that fight in your defence: Unsheathe your sword, good father, cry 'Saint George!' March.

Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!",Human
"Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king? I am his king, and he should bow his knee, I was adopted heir by his consent: Since when, his oath is broke, for, as I hear, You, that are king, though he do wear the crown, Have caused him, by new act of parliament, To blot out me, and put his own son in. And reason too: Who should succeed the father but the son? Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak! Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee, Or any he the proudest of thy sort. 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not? Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight. What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown? Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak? When you and I met at Saint Alban's last, Your legs did better service than your hands. Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine. You said so much before, and yet you fled. 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence. No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay. Northumberland, I hold thee reverently. Break off the parley, for scarce I can refrain The execution of my big-swoln heart Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer. I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child? Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward, As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland, But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed. Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak. Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips. I prithee, give no limits to my tongue: I am a king, and privileged to speak. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here Cannot be cured by words, therefore be still. Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword: By him that made us all, I am resolved that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue. Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no? A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day, That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown. If thou deny, their blood upon thy head, For York in justice puts his armour on. If that be right which Warwick says is right, There is no wrong, but every thing is right. Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands, For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.",Human

Iron of Naples hid with English gilt, Whose father bears the title of a king,-- As if a channel should be call'd the sea,-- Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught, To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart? A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns, To make this shameless callet know herself. Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou, Although thy husband may be Menelaus, And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd By that false woman, as this king by thee. His father revell'd in the heart of France, And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop, And had he match'd according to his state, He might have kept that glory to this day, But when he took a beggar to his bed, And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day, Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him, That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France, And heap'd sedition on his crown at home. For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride? Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept, And we, in pity of the gentle king, Had slipp'd our claim until another age. But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring, And that thy summer bred us no increase, We set the axe to thy usurping root, And though the edge hath something hit ourselves, Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike, We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down, Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods. And, in this resolution, I defy thee, Not willing any longer conference, Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak. Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave! And either victory, or else a grave.

Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings, And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit. Enter RICHARD Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself? Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk, Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance, And in the very pangs of death he cried, Like to a dismal clangour heard from far, 'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!' So, underneath the belly of their steeds, That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood, The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.

Why stand we like soft-hearted women here, Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage, And look upon, as if the tragedy Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors? Here on my knee I vow to God above, I'll never pause again, never stand still, Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine Or fortune given me measure of revenge. O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine, And in this vow do chain my soul to thine! And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face, I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee, Thou setter up and plucker down of kings, Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands That to my foes this body must be prey, Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope, And give sweet passage to my sinful soul! Now, lords, take leave until we meet again, Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth. Brother, give me thy hand, and, gentle Warwick, Let me embrace thee in my weary arms: I, that did never weep, now melt with woe That winter should cut off our spring-time so. Away, away!

O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon, And hath bereft thee of thy life too late! Woe above woe! grief more than common grief! O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds! O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity! The red rose and the white are on his face, The fatal colours of our striving houses: The one his purple blood right well resembles, The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth: Wither one rose, and let the other flourish, If you contend, a thousand lives must wither. How will my mother for a father's death Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied! How will my wife for slaughter of my son Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied! How will the country for these woful chances Misthink the king and not be satisfied! Was ever son so rued a father's death? Was ever father so bemoan'd his son? Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe? Much is your sorrow, mine ten times so much. I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill. Exit with the body These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet, My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre, For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go, My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell, And so obsequious will thy father be, Even for the loss of thee, having no more, As Priam was for all his valiant sons. I'll bear thee hence, and let them fight that will,",Human
"For I have murdered where I should not kill. Exit with the body Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care, Here sits a king more woful than you are. Alarums: excursions. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, and EXETER Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled, And Warwick rages like a chafed bull: Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit. Mount you, my lord, towards Berwick post amain: Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds Having the fearful flying hare in sight, With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath, And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands, Are at our backs, and therefore hence amain. Away! for vengeance comes along with them: Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed, Or else come after: I'll away before. Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter: Not that I fear to stay, but love to go Whither the queen intends. Forward, away! Exeunt SCENE VI. Another part of the field. A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded Here burns my candle out, ay, here it dies, Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light. O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow More than my body's parting with my soul! My love and fear glued many friends to thee, And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts. Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York, The common people swarm like summer flies, And whither fly the gnats but to the sun? And who shines now but Henry's enemies? O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds, Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth! And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do, Or as thy father and his father did, Giving no ground unto the house of York, They never then had sprung like summer flies, I and ten thousand in this luckless realm Had left no mourning widows for our death, And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace. For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air? And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity? Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds, No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight: The foe is merciless, and will not pity, For at their hands I have deserved no pity. The air hath got into my deadly wounds,",Human
"And much effuse of blood doth make me faint. Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest, I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast. He faints Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause, And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks. Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen, That led calm Henry, though he were a king, As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust, Command an argosy to stem the waves. But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them? No, 'tis impossible he should escape, For, though before his face I speak the words Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave: And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead. CLIFFORD groans, and dies Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave? A deadly groan, like life and death's departing. See who it is: and, now the battle's ended, If friend or foe, let him be gently used. Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford, Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth, But set his murdering knife unto the root From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring, I mean our princely father, Duke of York. From off the gates of York fetch down the head, Your father's head, which Clifford placed there, Instead whereof let this supply the room: Measure for measure must be answered. Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house, That nothing sung but death to us and ours: Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound, And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak. I think his understanding is bereft. Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee? Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life, And he nor sees nor hears us what we say. O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth: 'Tis but his policy to counterfeit, Because he would avoid such bitter taunts Which in the time of death he gave our father. If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words. Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace. Clifford, repent in bootless penitence. Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults. While we devise fell tortures for thy faults. Thou didst love York, and I am son to York. Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee.",Human
"Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now? They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont. What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath. I know by that he's dead, and, by my soul, If this right hand would buy two hour's life, That I in all despite might rail at him, This hand should chop it off, and with the issuing blood Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst York and young Rutland could not satisfy. Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head, And rear it in the place your father's stands. And now to London with triumphant march, There to be crowned England's royal king: From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France, And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen: So shalt thou sinew both these lands together, And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again, For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt, Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears. First will I see the coronation, And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea, To effect this marriage, so it please my lord. Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be, For in thy shoulder do I build my seat, And never will I undertake the thing Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting. Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester, And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself, Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best. Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester, For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous. Tut, that's a foolish observation: Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London, To see these honours in possession. Exeunt ACT III SCENE I. A forest in the north of England. Enter two Keepers, with cross-bows in their hands Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves, For through this laund anon the deer will come, And in this covert will we make our stand, Culling the principal of all the deer. I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot. That cannot be, the noise of thy cross-bow Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost. Here stand we both, and aim we at the best: And, for the time shall not seem tedious,",Human
"I'll tell thee what befell me on a day In this self-place where now we mean to stand. Here comes a man, let's stay till he be past. Enter KING HENRY VI, disguised, with a prayerbook From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love, To greet mine own land with my wishful sight. No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine, Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee, Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed: No bending knee will call thee Caesar now, No humble suitors press to speak for right, No, not a man comes for redress of thee, For how can I help them, and not myself? Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee: This is the quondam king, let's seize upon him. Let me embrace thee, sour adversity, For wise men say it is the wisest course. Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him. Forbear awhile, we'll hear a little more. My queen and son are gone to France for aid, And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister To wife for Edward: if this news be true, Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost, For Warwick is a subtle orator, And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words. By this account then Margaret may win him, For she's a woman to be pitied much: Her sighs will make a battery in his breast, Her tears will pierce into a marble heart, The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn, And Nero will be tainted with remorse, To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears. Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give, She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry, He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward. She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed, He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd, That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more, Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong, Inferreth arguments of mighty strength, And in conclusion wins the king from her, With promise of his sister, and what else, To strengthen and support King Edward's place. O Margaret, thus 'twill be, and thou, poor soul, Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn! Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens? More than I seem, and less than I was born to: A man at least, for less I should not be, And men may talk of kings, and why not I?",Human
"Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king. Why, so I am, in mind, and that's enough. But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown? My crown is in my heart, not on my head, Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones, Nor to be seen: my crown is called content: A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy. Well, if you be a king crown'd with content, Your crown content and you must be contented To go along with us, for as we think, You are the king King Edward hath deposed, And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance Will apprehend you as his enemy. But did you never swear, and break an oath? No, never such an oath, nor will not now. Where did you dwell when I was King of England? Here in this country, where we now remain. I was anointed king at nine months old, My father and my grandfather were kings, And you were sworn true subjects unto me: And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths? No, For we were subjects but while you were king. Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man? Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear! Look, as I blow this feather from my face, And as the air blows it to me again, Obeying with my wind when I do blow, And yielding to another when it blows, Commanded always by the greater gust, Such is the lightness of you common men. But do not break your oaths, for of that sin My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty. Go where you will, the king shall be commanded, And be you kings, command, and I'll obey. We are true subjects to the king, King Edward. So would you be again to Henry, If he were seated as King Edward is. We charge you, in God's name, and the king's, To go with us unto the officers. In God's name, lead, your king's name be obey'd: And what God will, that let your king perform, And what he will, I humbly yield unto. Exeunt SCENE II. London. The palace. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and LADY GREY Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain, His lands then seized on by the conqueror: Her suit is now to repossess those lands,",Human
"Which we in justice cannot well deny, Because in quarrel of the house of York The worthy gentleman did lose his life. Your highness shall do well to grant her suit, It were dishonour to deny it her. It were no less, but yet I'll make a pause. [Aside to CLARENCE]  Yea, is it so? I see the lady hath a thing to grant, Before the king will grant her humble suit. [Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He knows the game: how true he keeps the wind! [Aside to CLARENCE]  Silence! Widow, we will consider of your suit, And come some other time to know our mind. Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay: May it please your highness to resolve me now, And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me. [Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, widow? then I'll warrant you all your lands, An if what pleases him shall pleasure you. Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow. [Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I fear her not, unless she chance to fall. [Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that! for he'll take vantages. How many children hast thou, widow? tell me. [Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I think he means to beg a child of her. [Aside to CLARENCE]  Nay, whip me then: he'll rather give her two. Three, my most gracious lord. [Aside to CLARENCE]  You shall have four, if you'll be ruled by him. 'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands. Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then. Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit. [Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, good leave have you, for you will have leave, Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch. GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire Now tell me, madam, do you love your children? Ay, full as dearly as I love myself. And would you not do much to do them good? To do them good, I would sustain some harm. Then get your husband's lands, to do them good. Therefore I came unto your majesty. I'll tell you how these lands are to be got. So shall you bind me to your highness' service. What service wilt thou do me, if I give them? What you command, that rests in me to do.",Human
"But you will take exceptions to my boon. No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it. Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask. Why, then I will do what your grace commands. [Aside to CLARENCE]  He plies her hard, and much rain wears the marble. [Aside to GLOUCESTER]  As red as fire! nay, then her wax must melt. Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task? An easy task, 'tis but to love a king. That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject. Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee. I take my leave with many thousand thanks. [Aside to CLARENCE]  The match is made, she seals it with a curtsy. But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege. Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense. What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get? My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers, That love which virtue begs and virtue grants. No, by my troth, I did not mean such love. Why, then you mean not as I thought you did. But now you partly may perceive my mind. My mind will never grant what I perceive Your highness aims at, if I aim aright. To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee. To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison. Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands. Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower, For by that loss I will not purchase them. Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily. Herein your highness wrongs both them and me. But, mighty lord, this merry inclination Accords not with the sadness of my suit: Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.' Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request, No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand. Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end. [Aside to CLARENCE]  The widow likes him not, she knits her brows. [Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom. [Aside]  Her looks do argue her replete with modesty, Her words do show her wit incomparable, All her perfections challenge sovereignty: One way or other, she is for a king, And she shall be my love, or else my queen.-- Say that King Edward take thee for his queen? 'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:",Human
"I am a subject fit to jest withal, But far unfit to be a sovereign. Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee I speak no more than what my soul intends, And that is, to enjoy thee for my love. And that is more than I will yield unto: I know I am too mean to be your queen, And yet too good to be your concubine. You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen. 'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father. No more than when my daughters call thee mother. Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children, And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor, Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing To be the father unto many sons. Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen. [Aside to CLARENCE]  The ghostly father now hath done his shrift. [Aside to GLOUCESTER]  When he was made a shriver, 'twas for shift. Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had. The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad. You'll think it strange if I should marry her. To whom, my lord? Why, Clarence, to myself. That would be ten days' wonder at the least. That's a day longer than a wonder lasts. By so much is the wonder in extremes. Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both Her suit is granted for her husband's lands. Enter a Nobleman My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken, And brought your prisoner to your palace gate. See that he be convey'd unto the Tower: And go we, brothers, to the man that took him, To question of his apprehension. Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER Ay, Edward will use women honourably. Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all, That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring, To cross me from the golden time I look for! And yet, between my soul's desire and me-- The lustful Edward's title buried-- Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward, And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies, To take their rooms, ere I can place myself: A cold premeditation for my purpose! Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty, Like one that stands upon a promontory,",Human
"And spies a far-off shore where he would tread, Wishing his foot were equal with his eye, And chides the sea that sunders him from thence, Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way: So do I wish the crown, being so far off, And so I chide the means that keeps me from it, And so I say, I'll cut the causes off, Flattering me with impossibilities. My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much, Unless my hand and strength could equal them. Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard, What other pleasure can the world afford? I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap, And deck my body in gay ornaments, And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks. O miserable thought! and more unlikely Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns! Why, love forswore me in my  mother's womb: And, for I should not deal in her soft laws, She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe, To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub, To make an envious mountain on my back, Where sits deformity to mock my body, To shape my legs of an unequal size, To disproportion me in every part, Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp That carries no impression like the dam. And am I then a man to be beloved? O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought! Then, since this earth affords no joy to me, But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such As are of better person than myself, I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown, And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell, Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head Be round impaled with a glorious crown. And yet I know not how to get the crown, For many lives stand between me and home: And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood, That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns, Seeking a way and straying from the way, Not knowing how to find the open air, But toiling desperately to find it out,-- Torment myself to catch the English crown: And from that torment I will free myself, Or hew my way out with a bloody axe. Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile, And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart, And wet my cheeks with artificial tears, And frame my face to all occasions.",Human
"I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall, I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk, I'll play the orator as well as Nestor, Deceive more slily than Ulysses could, And, like a Sinon, take another Troy. I can add colours to the chameleon, Change shapes with Proteus for advantages, And set the murderous Machiavel to school. Can I do this, and cannot get a crown? Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down. Exit SCENE III. France. KING LEWIS XI's palace. Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI, his sister BONA,  his Admiral, called BOURBON, PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN  MARGARET, and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI sits, and riseth up again Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret, Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit. No, mighty King of France: now Margaret Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve Where kings command. I was, I must confess, Great Albion's queen in former golden days: But now mischance hath trod my title down, And with dishonour laid me on the ground, Where I must take like seat unto my fortune, And to my humble seat conform myself. Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair? From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares. Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself, And sit thee by our side: Seats her by him Yield not thy neck To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind Still ride in triumph over all mischance. Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief, It shall be eased, if France can yield relief. Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak. Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis, That Henry, sole possessor of my love, Is of a king become a banish'd man, And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn, While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York Usurps the regal title and the seat Of England's true-anointed lawful king. This is the cause that I, poor Margaret, With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir, Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid, And if thou fail us, all our hope is done: Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help, Our people and our peers are both misled,",Human
"Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight, And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight. Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm, While we bethink a means to break it off. The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe. The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee. O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow. And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow! Enter WARWICK What's he approacheth boldly to our presence? Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend. Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France? He descends. She ariseth Ay, now begins a second storm to rise, For this is he that moves both wind and tide. From worthy Edward, King of Albion, My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend, I come, in kindness and unfeigned love, First, to do greetings to thy royal person, And then to crave a league of amity, And lastly, to confirm that amity With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister, To England's king in lawful marriage. [Aside]  If that go forward, Henry's hope is done. [To BONA]  And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf, I am commanded, with your leave and favour, Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart, Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears, Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue. King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak, Before you answer Warwick. His demand Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love, But from deceit bred by necessity, For how can tyrants safely govern home, Unless abroad they purchase great alliance? To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice, That Henry liveth still: but were he dead, Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son. Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour, For though usurpers sway the rule awhile, Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs. Injurious Margaret! And why not queen? Because thy father Henry did usurp, And thou no more are prince than she is queen. Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt, Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain,",Human
"And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth, Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest, And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth, Who by his prowess conquered all France: From these our Henry lineally descends. Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse, You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost All that which Henry Fifth had gotten? Methinks these peers of France should smile at that. But for the rest, you tell a pedigree Of threescore and two years, a silly time To make prescription for a kingdom's worth. Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege, Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years, And not bewray thy treason with a blush? Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right, Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree? For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king. Call him my king by whose injurious doom My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere, Was done to death? and more than so, my father, Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years, When nature brought him to the door of death? No, Warwick, no, while life upholds this arm, This arm upholds the house of Lancaster. And I the house of York. Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford, Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside, While I use further conference with Warwick. They stand aloof Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not! Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience, Is Edward your true king? for I were loath To link with him that were not lawful chosen. Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour. But is he gracious in the people's eye? The more that Henry was unfortunate. Then further, all dissembling set aside, Tell me for truth the measure of his love Unto our sister Bona. Such it seems As may beseem a monarch like himself. Myself have often heard him say and swear That this his love was an eternal plant, Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground, The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun, Exempt from envy, but not from disdain, Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain. Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve. Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:",Human
"To WARWICK Yet I confess that often ere this day, When I have heard your king's desert recounted, Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire. Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's, And now forthwith shall articles be drawn Touching the jointure that your king must make, Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised. Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness That Bona shall be wife to the English king. To Edward, but not to the English king. Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device By this alliance to make void my suit: Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend. And still is friend to him and Margaret: But if your title to the crown be weak, As may appear by Edward's good success, Then 'tis but reason that I be released From giving aid which late I promised. Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand That your estate requires and mine can yield. Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease, Where having nothing, nothing can he lose. And as for you yourself, our quondam queen, You have a father able to maintain you, And better 'twere you troubled him than France. Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace, Proud setter up and puller down of kings! I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears, Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love, For both of you are birds of selfsame feather. Post blows a horn within Warwick, this is some post to us or thee. Enter a Post [To WARWICK]  My lord ambassador, these letters are for you, Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague: To KING LEWIS XI These from our king unto your majesty: To QUEEN MARGARET And, madam, these for you, from whom I know not. They all read their letters I like it well that our fair queen and mistress Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his. Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled: I hope all's for the best. Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen? Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys. Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent. What! has your king married the Lady Grey!",Human
"And now, to soothe your forgery and his, Sends me a paper to persuade me patience? Is this the alliance that he seeks with France? Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner? I told your majesty as much before: This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty. King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven, And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss, That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's, No more my king, for he dishonours me, But most himself, if he could see his shame. Did I forget that by the house of York My father came untimely to his death? Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece? Did I impale him with the regal crown? Did I put Henry from his native right? And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame? Shame on himself! for my desert is honour: And to repair my honour lost for him, I here renounce him and return to Henry. My noble queen, let former grudges pass, And henceforth I am thy true servitor: I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona, And replant Henry in his former state. Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love, And I forgive and quite forget old faults, And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend. So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend, That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us With some few bands of chosen soldiers, I'll undertake to land them on our coast And force the tyrant from his seat by war. 'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him: And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me, He's very likely now to fall from him, For matching more for wanton lust than honour, Or than for strength and safety of our country. Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged But by thy help to this distressed queen? Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live, Unless thou rescue him from foul despair? My quarrel and this English queen's are one. And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours. And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's. Therefore at last I firmly am resolved You shall have aid. Let me give humble thanks for all at once. Then, England's messenger, return in post, And tell false Edward, thy supposed king, That Lewis of France is sending over masquers",Human
"To revel it with him and his new bride: Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal. Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly, I'll wear the willow garland for his sake. Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside, And I am ready to put armour on. Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long. There's thy reward: be gone. Exit Post But, Warwick, Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men, Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle, And, as occasion serves, this noble queen And prince shall follow with a fresh supply. Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt, What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty? This shall assure my constant loyalty, That if our queen and this young prince agree, I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands. Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion. Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous, Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick, And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable, That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine. Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it, And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand. He gives his hand to WARWICK Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied, And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral, Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet. I long till Edward fall by war's mischance, For mocking marriage with a dame of France. Exeunt all but WARWICK I came from Edward as ambassador, But I return his sworn and mortal foe: Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me, But dreadful war shall answer his demand. Had he none else to make a stale but me? Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow. I was the chief that raised him to the crown, And I'll be chief to bring him down again: Not that I pity Henry's misery, But seek revenge on Edward's mockery. Exit ACT IV SCENE I. London. The palace.

"Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey? Hath not our brother made a worthy choice? Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France, How could he stay till Warwick made return? My lords, forbear this talk, here comes the king. And his well-chosen bride. I mind to tell him plainly what I think. Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, attended, QUEEN ELIZABETH, PEMBROKE, STAFFORD, HASTINGS, and others Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice, That you stand pensive, as half malcontent? As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick, Which are so weak of courage and in judgment That they'll take no offence at our abuse. Suppose they take offence without a cause, They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward, Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will. And shall have your will, because our king: Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well. Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too? Not I: No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd Whom God hath join'd together, ay, and 'twere pity To sunder them that yoke so well together. Setting your scorns and your mislike aside, Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey Should not become my wife and England's queen. And you too, Somerset and Montague, Speak freely what you think. Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis Becomes your enemy, for mocking him About the marriage of the Lady Bona. And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge, Is now dishonoured by this new marriage. What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased By such invention as I can devise? Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth 'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage. Why, knows not Montague that of itself England is safe, if true within itself? But the safer when 'tis back'd with France. 'Tis better using France than trusting France: Let us be back'd with God and with the seas Which He hath given for fence impregnable, And with their helps only defend ourselves, In them and in ourselves our safety lies. For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford. Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant, And for this once my will shall stand for law.",Human
"And yet methinks your grace hath not done well, To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales Unto the brother of your loving bride, She better would have fitted me or Clarence: But in your bride you bury brotherhood. Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son, And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere. Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee. In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment, Which being shallow, you give me leave To play the broker in mine own behalf, And to that end I shortly mind to leave you. Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king, And not be tied unto his brother's will. My lords, before it pleased his majesty To raise my state to title of a queen, Do me but right, and you must all confess That I was not ignoble of descent, And meaner than myself have had like fortune. But as this title honours me and mine, So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing, Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow. My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns: What danger or what sorrow can befall thee, So long as Edward is thy constant friend, And their true sovereign, whom they must obey? Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too, Unless they seek for hatred at my hands, Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe, And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath. [Aside]  I hear, yet say not much, but think the more. Enter a Post Now, messenger, what letters or what news From France? My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words, But such as I, without your special pardon, Dare not relate. Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief, Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them. What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters? At my depart, these were his very words: 'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king, That Lewis of France is sending over masquers To revel it with him and his new bride.' Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry. But what said Lady Bona to my marriage? These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain: 'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,",Human
"I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.' I blame not her, she could say little less, She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen? For I have heard that she was there in place. 'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done, And I am ready to put armour on.' Belike she minds to play the Amazon. But what said Warwick to these injuries? He, more incensed against your majesty Than all the rest, discharged me with these words: 'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.' Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words? Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd: They shall have wars and pay for their presumption. But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret? Ay, gracious sovereign, they are so link'd in friendship That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter. Belike the elder, Clarence will have the younger. Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast, For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter, That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage I may not prove inferior to yourself. You that love me and Warwick, follow me. Exit CLARENCE, and SOMERSET follows [Aside]  Not I: My thoughts aim at a further matter, I Stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown. Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick! Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen, And haste is needful in this desperate case. Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf Go levy men, and make prepare for war, They are already, or quickly will be landed: Myself in person will straight follow you. Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague, Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest, Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance: Tell me if you love Warwick more than me? If it be so, then both depart to him, I rather wish you foes than hollow friends: But if you mind to hold your true obedience, Give me assurance with some friendly vow, That I may never have you in suspect. So God help Montague as he proves true! And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause! Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us? Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.",Human

Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick, And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice To rest mistrustful where a noble heart Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love, Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother, Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings: But welcome, sweet Clarence, my daughter shall be thine. And now what rests but, in night's coverture, Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd, His soldiers lurking in the towns about, And but attended by a simple guard, We may surprise and take him at our pleasure? Our scouts have found the adventure very easy: That as Ulysses and stout Diomede With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents, And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds, So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle, At unawares may beat down Edward's guard And seize himself, I say not, slaughter him, For I intend but only to surprise him. You that will follow me to this attempt, Applaud the name of Henry with your leader. They all cry, 'Henry!'

"'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend. O, is it so? But why commands the king That his chief followers lodge in towns about him, While he himself keeps in the cold field? 'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous. Ay, but give me worship and quietness, I like it better than a dangerous honour. If Warwick knew in what estate he stands, 'Tis to be doubted he would waken him. Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.

RICHARD and HASTINGS fly over the stage What are they that fly there? Richard and Hastings: let them go, here is The duke. The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted, Thou call'dst me king. Ay, but the case is alter'd: When you disgraced me in my embassade, Then I degraded you from being king, And come now to create you Duke of York. Alas! how should you govern any kingdom, That know not how to use ambassadors, Nor how to be contented with one wife, Nor how to use your brothers brotherly, Nor how to study for the people's welfare, Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies? Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too? Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down. Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance, Of thee thyself and all thy complices, Edward will always bear himself as king: Though fortune's malice overthrow my state, My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel. Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king: Takes off his crown But Henry now shall wear the English crown, And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.

What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick? No, but the loss of his own royal person. Then is my sovereign slain? Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner, Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard Or by his foe surprised at unawares: And, as I further have to understand, Is new committed to the Bishop of York, Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe. These news I must confess are full of grief, Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may: Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day. Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay. And I the rather wean me from despair For love of Edward's offspring in my womb: This is it that makes me bridle passion And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross, Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs, Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown. But, madam, where is Warwick then become? I am inform'd that he comes towards London, To set the crown once more on Henry's head: Guess thou the rest, King Edward's friends must down, But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,-- For trust not him that hath once broken faith,-- I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary, To save at least the heir of Edward's right: There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.

Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother, Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands He hath good usage and great liberty, And, often but attended with weak guard, Comes hunting this way to disport himself. I have advertised him by secret means That if about this hour he make his way Under the colour of his usual game, He shall here find his friends with horse and men To set him free from his captivity. Enter KING EDWARD IV and a Huntsman with him This way, my lord, for this way lies the game. Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand. Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest, Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer? Brother, the time and case requireth haste: Your horse stands ready at the park-corner. But whither shall we then? To Lynn, my lord, And ship from thence to Flanders. Well guess'd, believe me, for that was my meaning. Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness. But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk. Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along? Better do so than tarry and be hang'd. Come then, away, let's ha' no more ado.

Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns, But if an humble prayer may prevail, I then crave pardon of your majesty. For what, lieutenant? for well using me? Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness, For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure, Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds Conceive when after many moody thoughts At last by notes of household harmony",Human
"They quite forget their loss of liberty. But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free, And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee, He was the author, thou the instrument. Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me, And that the people of this blessed land May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars, Warwick, although my head still wear the crown, I here resign my government to thee, For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds. Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous, And now may seem as wise as virtuous, By spying and avoiding fortune's malice, For few men rightly temper with the stars: Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace, For choosing me when Clarence is in place. No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway, To whom the heavens in thy nativity Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown, As likely to be blest in peace and war, And therefore I yield thee my free consent. And I choose Clarence only for protector. Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands: Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts, That no dissension hinder government: I make you both protectors of this land, While I myself will lead a private life And in devotion spend my latter days, To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise. What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will? That he consents, if Warwick yield consent, For on thy fortune I repose myself. Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content: We'll yoke together, like a double shadow To Henry's body, and supply his place, I mean, in bearing weight of government, While he enjoys the honour and his ease. And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor, And all his lands and goods be confiscate. What else? and that succession be determined. Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part. But, with the first of all your chief affairs, Let me entreat, for I command no more, That Margaret your queen and my son Edward Be sent for, to return from France with speed, For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.

That Edward is escaped from your brother, And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy. Unsavoury news! but how made he escape? He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester And the Lord Hastings, who attended him In secret ambush on the forest side And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him, For hunting was his daily exercise. My brother was too careless of his charge. But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide A salve for any sore that may betide.

Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd: Then why should they love Edward more than me?

Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence, Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own, Call Warwick patron and be penitent? And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.

Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast, But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten, The king was slily finger'd from the deck!

Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath: To keep that oath were more impiety Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter. I am so sorry for my trespass made That, to deserve well at my brother's hands, I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe, With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee-- As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad-- To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.

Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends: And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults, For I will henceforth be no more unconstant. Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved, Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate. Welcome, good Clarence, this is brotherlike. O passing traitor, perjured and unjust! What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight? Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears? Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence! I will away towards Barnet presently, And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest. Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way. Lords, to the field, Saint George and victory!

"My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows. That I must yield my body to the earth And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe. Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge, Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle, Under whose shade the ramping lion slept, Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind. These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil, Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun, To search the secret treasons of the world: The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood, Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres, For who lived king, but I could dig his grave? And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow? Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood! My parks, my walks, my manors that I had. Even now forsake me, and of all my lands Is nothing left me but my body's length. Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust? And, live we how we can, yet die we must.

We might recover all our loss again, The queen from France hath brought a puissant power: Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly! Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague, If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand. And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile! Thou lovest me not, for, brother, if thou didst, Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood That glues my lips and will not let me speak. Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead. Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last, And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick, And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.' And more he would have said, and more he spoke, Which sounded like a clamour in a vault, That mought not be distinguished, but at last I well might hear, delivered with a groan, 'O, farewell, Warwick!' Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves, For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven. Dies Away, away, to meet the queen's great power! Here they bear away his body.

"But, in the midst of this bright-shining day, I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud, That will encounter with our glorious sun, Ere he attain his easeful western bed: I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast And, as we hear, march on to fight with us. A little gale will soon disperse that cloud And blow it to the source from whence it came: The very beams will dry those vapours up, For every cloud engenders not a storm. The queen is valued thirty thousand strong, And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her: If she have time to breathe be well assured Her faction will be full as strong as ours. We are advertised by our loving friends That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury: We, having now the best at Barnet field, Will thither straight, for willingness rids way, And, as we march, our strength will be augmented In every county as we go along.

Is't meet that he Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad With tearful eyes add water to the sea And give more strength to that which hath too much, Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock, Which industry and courage might have saved? Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this! Say Warwick was our anchor, what of that? And Montague our topmost, what of him? Our slaughter'd friends the tackles, what of these? Why, is not Oxford here another anchor? And Somerset another goodly mast? The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings? And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?

Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided 'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear. Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit Should, if a coward heard her speak these words, Infuse his breast with magnanimity And make him, naked, foil a man at arms. I speak not this as doubting any here For did I but suspect a fearful man He should have leave to go away betimes, Lest in our need he might infect another And make him of like spirit to himself. If any such be here--as God forbid!-- Let him depart before we need his help. Women and children of so high a courage, And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.

Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words! My breast can better brook thy dagger's point Than can my ears that tragic history. But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life? Think'st thou I am an executioner? A persecutor, I am sure, thou art: If murdering innocents be executing, Why, then thou art an executioner. Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.

The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign, The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time, Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees, The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top, And chattering pies in dismal discords sung. Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain, And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope, To wit, an indigested and deformed lump, Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.

The midwife wonder'd and the women cried 'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!' And so I was, which plainly signified That I should snarl and bite and play the dog. Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so, Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.

You shall find of the king a husband, madam, you, sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance. What hope is there of his majesty's amendment? He hath abandoned his physicians, madam, under whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time. This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that 'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was almost as great as his honesty, had it stretched so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for the king's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of the king's disease. How called you the man you speak of, madam? He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon. He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality. What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of? A fistula, my lord. I heard not of it before. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon? His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises, her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer, for where",Human

The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena, go to, no more, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have it. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal. Madam, I desire your holy wishes.

"Must I be comforted, not in his sphere. The ambition in my love thus plagues itself: The hind that would be mated by the lion Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague, To see him every hour, to sit and draw His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, In our heart's table, heart too capable Of every line and trick of his sweet favour: But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here? Enter PAROLLES Aside One that goes with him: I love him for his sake, And yet I know him a notorious liar, Think him a great way fool, solely a coward, Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him, That they take place, when virtue's steely bones Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly. Save you, fair queen! And you, monarch! No. And no. Are you meditating on virginity? Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity, how may we barricado it against him? Keep him out. But he assails, and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some warlike resistance. There is none: man, sitting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up! Is there no military policy, how virgins might blow up men? Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found, by being ever kept, it is ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion, away with 't! I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin. There's little can be said in 't, 'tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity, is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible",Human
"disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not, you cannot choose but loose by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse: away with 't! How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking? Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying, the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't while 'tis vendible, answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek, and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily, marry, 'tis a withered pear, it was formerly better, marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?

Now shall he-- I know not what he shall. God send him well! The court's a learning place, and he is one-- What one, i' faith? That I wish well. 'Tis pity-- What's pity? That wishing well had not a body in't, Which might be felt, that we, the poorer born, Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes, Might with effects of them follow our friends, And show what we alone must think, which never Return us thanks.

You go so much backward when you fight. That's for advantage. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety, but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.

He did look far Into the service of the time and was Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long, But on us both did haggish age steal on And wore us out of act. It much repairs me To talk of your good father. In his youth He had the wit which I can well observe To-day in our young lords, but they may jest Till their own scorn return to them unnoted Ere they can hide their levity in honour, So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness Were in his pride or sharpness, if they were, His equal had awaked them, and his honour, Clock to itself, knew the true minute when Exception bid him speak, and at this time His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him He used as creatures of another place And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks, Making them proud of his humility, In their poor praise he humbled.

What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah: the complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not, for I know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.

"your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may. Wilt thou needs be a beggar? I do beg your good will in this case. In what case? In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage: and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o' my body, for they say barnes are blessings. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry. My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on by the flesh, and he must needs go that the devil drives. Is this all your worship's reason? Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they are. May the world know them? I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are, and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent. Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness. I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my wife's sake. Such friends are thine enemies, knave. You're shallow, madam, in great friends, for the knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop, if I be his cuckold, he's my drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood, he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood, he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage, for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in religion, their heads are both one, they may jowl horns together, like any deer i' the herd. Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave? A prophet I, madam, and I speak the truth the next way: For I the ballad will repeat, Which men full true shall find, Your marriage comes by destiny, Your cuckoo sings by kind. Get you gone, sir, I'll talk with you more anon. May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you: of her I am to speak. Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her, Helen, I mean.

"Why the Grecians sacked Troy? Fond done, done fond, Was this King Priam's joy? With that she sighed as she stood, With that she sighed as she stood, And gave this sentence then, Among nine bad if one be good, Among nine bad if one be good, There's yet one good in ten. What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah. One good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o' the song: would God would serve the world so all the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we might have a good woman born but one every blazing star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck one.

Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt, it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither. Exit Well, now. I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely. Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me, and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds: there is more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid her than she'll demand. Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears, she thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son: Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates, Love no god, that would not extend his might, only where qualities were level, Dian no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surprised, without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal, sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it. You have discharged this honestly, keep it to yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this",Human

Nor I your mother? You are my mother, madam, would you were,-- So that my lord your son were not my brother,-- Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers, I care no more for than I do for heaven, So I were not his sister.

Then, I confess, Here on my knee, before high heaven and you, That before you, and next unto high heaven, I love your son. My friends were poor, but honest, so's my love: Be not offended, for it hurts not him That he is loved of me: I follow him not By any token of presumptuous suit, Nor would I have him till I do deserve him, Yet never know how that desert should be. I know I love in vain, strive against hope, Yet in this captious and intenible sieve I still pour in the waters of my love And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like, Religious in mine error, I adore The sun, that looks upon his worshipper, But knows of him no more.

Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions? From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question.

A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding. My master! Are you companion to the Count Rousillon? To any count, to all counts, to what is man. To what is count's man: count's master is of another style. You are too old, sir, let it satisfy you, you are too old. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man, to which title age cannot bring thee. What I dare too well do, I dare not do. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow, thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel, it might pass: yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I have now found thee, when I lose thee again, I care not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up, and that thou't scarce worth. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,-- Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial, which if--Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee well: thy casement I need not open, for I look through thee. Give me thy hand. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity. Ay, with all my heart, and thou art worthy of it. I have not, my lord, deserved it. Yes, good faith, every dram of it, and I will not bate thee a scruple. Well, I shall be wiser. Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default, he is a man I know. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation. I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me leave.

I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good lord: whom I serve above is my master. Who? God? Ay, sir. The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee: I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord. Go to, sir, you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate, you are a vagabond and no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry.

There's letters from my mother: what the import is, I know not yet. Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars! He wears his honour in a box unseen, That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home, Spending his manly marrow in her arms, Which should sustain the bound and high curvet Of Mars's fiery steed.

Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure? Go with me to my chamber, and advise me. I'll send her straight away: to-morrow I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.

If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's not very well? Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things. What two things? One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly! Enter PAROLLES Bless you, my fortunate lady!

Marry, you are the wiser man, for many a man's tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your title, which is within a very little of nothing.

I know that knave, hang him! one Parolles: a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of them, Diana, their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid hath been seduced by them, and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them.

He stole from France, As 'tis reported, for the king had married him Against his liking: think you it is so? Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady. There is a gentleman that serves the count Reports but coarsely of her. What's his name? Monsieur Parolles.

"more in your respect. On my life, my lord, a bubble. Do you think I am so far deceived in him? Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment. It were fit you knew him, lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you. I would I knew in what particular action to try him. None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do. I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly surprise him, such I will have, whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at his examination: if he do not, for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in any thing. O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum, he says he has a stratagem for't: when your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes. Enter PAROLLES [Aside to BERTRAM]  O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch off his drum in any hand. How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your disposition. A pox on't, let it go, 'tis but a drum. 'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost! There was excellent command,--to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers! That was not to be blamed in the command of the service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had been there to command. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum, but it is",Human
"not to be recovered. It might have been recovered. It might, but it is not now. It is to be recovered: but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.' Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on, I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it. and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness. By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it. But you must not now slumber in it. I'll about it this evening: and I will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation, and by midnight look to hear further from me. May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it? I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the attempt I vow. I know thou'rt valiant, and, to the possibility of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell. I love not many words. Exit No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done, damns himself to do and dares better be damned than to do't? You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries, but when you find him out, you have him ever after. Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto? None in the world, but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we have almost embossed him, you shall see his fall to-night, for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect. We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him.

I have yielded: Instruct my daughter how she shall persever, That time and place with this deceit so lawful May prove coherent. Every night he comes With musics of all sorts and songs composed To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us To chide him from our eaves, for he persists As if his life lay on't. Why then to-night Let us assay our plot, which, if it speed, Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed And lawful meaning in a lawful act, Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact: But let's about it. Exeunt ACT IV SCENE I. Without the Florentine camp. Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will: though you understand it not yourselves, no matter, for we must not seem to understand him, unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter. Good captain, let me be the interpreter. Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice? No, sir, I warrant you. But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again? E'en such as you speak to me. He must think us some band of strangers i' the adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we speak one to another, so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language, gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges. Enter PAROLLES Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be time enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that carries it: they begin to smoke me, and disgraces",Human
"have of late knocked too often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue. This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it, they will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the instance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils. Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is? I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword. We cannot afford you so. Or the baring of my beard, and to say it was in stratagem. 'Twould not do. Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped. Hardly serve. Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel. How deep? Thirty fathom. Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed. I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear I recovered it. You shall hear one anon.

Come on, thou art granted space. Exit, with PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother, We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled Till we do hear from them. Captain, I will. A' will betray us all unto ourselves: Inform on that. So I will, sir. Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd. Exeunt SCENE II. Florence. The Widow's house. Enter BERTRAM and DIANA They told me that your name was Fontibell. No, my good lord, Diana. Titled goddess, And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul, In your fine frame hath love no quality? If quick fire of youth light not your mind, You are no maiden, but a monument: When you are dead, you should be such a one As you are now, for you are cold and stem, And now you should be as your mother was When your sweet self was got. She then was honest. So should you be. No: My mother did but duty, such, my lord, As you owe to your wife. No more o' that, I prithee, do not strive against my vows: I was compell'd to her, but I love thee By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever Do thee all rights of service. Ay, so you serve us Till we serve you, but when you have our roses, You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves And mock us with our bareness.",Human
"How have I sworn! 'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth, But the plain single vow that is vow'd true. What is not holy, that we swear not by, But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me, If I should swear by God's great attributes, I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths, When I did love you ill? This has no holding, To swear by him whom I protest to love, That I will work against him: therefore your oaths Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd, At least in my opinion. Change it, change it, Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy, And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts That you do charge men with. Stand no more off, But give thyself unto my sick desires, Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever My love as it begins shall so persever. I see that men make ropes in such a scarre That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring. I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power To give it from me. Will you not, my lord? It is an honour 'longing to our house, Bequeathed down from many ancestors, Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world In me to lose. Mine honour's such a ring: My chastity's the jewel of our house, Bequeathed down from many ancestors, Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom Brings in the champion Honour on my part, Against your vain assault. Here, take my ring: My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine, And I'll be bid by thee. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window: I'll order take my mother shall not hear. Now will I charge you in the band of truth, When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed, Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me: My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them When back again this ring shall be deliver'd: And on your finger in the night I'll put Another ring, that what in time proceeds May token to the future our past deeds. Adieu, till then, then, fail not. You have won A wife of me, though there my hope be done.",Human
"A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee. Exit For which live long to thank both heaven and me! You may so in the end. My mother told me just how he would woo, As if she sat in 's heart, she says all men Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me When his wife's dead, therefore I'll lie with him When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid, Marry that will, I live and die a maid: Only in this disguise I think't no sin To cozen him that would unjustly win. Exit SCENE III. The Florentine camp. Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers You have not given him his mother's letter? I have delivered it an hour since: there is something in't that stings his nature, for on the reading it he changed almost into another man. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady. Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you. When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave of it. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most chaste renown, and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition. Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves, what things are we! Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends, so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself. Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company to-night? Not till after midnight, for he is dieted to his hour. That approaches apace, I would gladly have him see his company anatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit. We will not meddle with him till he come, for his presence must be the whip of the other. In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?",Human
"I hear there is an overture of peace. Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded. What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel higher, or return again into France? I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether of his council. Let it be forbid, sir, so should I be a great deal of his act. Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand, which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished, and, there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief, in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven. How is this justified? The stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true, even to the point of her death: her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place. Hath the count all this intelligence? Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, so to the full arming of the verity. I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses! And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our faults whipped them not, and our crimes would despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues. Enter a Messenger How now! where's your master? He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next morning for France. The duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king. They shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend. They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness. Here's his lordship now. Enter BERTRAM How now, my lord! is't not after midnight? I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success: I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest, buried a wife, mourned for her, writ to my",Human
"lady mother I am returning, entertained my convoy, and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs, the last was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet. If the business be of any difficulty, and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship. I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived me, like a double-meaning prophesier. Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night, poor gallant knave. No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry himself? I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry him. But to answer you as you would be understood, he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' the stocks: and what think you he hath confessed? Nothing of me, has a'? His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you are, you must have the patience to hear it. Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me: hush, hush! Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa He calls for the tortures: what will you say without 'em? I will confess what I know without constraint: if ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more. Bosko chimurcho. Boblibindo chicurmurco. You are a merciful general. Our general bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note. And truly, as I hope to live. [Reads]  'First demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.' What say you to that? Five or six thousand, but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation and credit and as I hope to live. Shall I set down your answer so? Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will. All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this! You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur",Human
"Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of his dagger. I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him by wearing his apparel neatly. Well, that's set down. Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth. He's very near the truth in this. But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he delivers it. Poor rogues, I pray you, say. Well, that's set down. I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the rogues are marvellous poor. [Reads]  'Demand of him, of what strength they are a-foot.' What say you to that? By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty, Sebastian, so many, Corambus, so many, Jaques, so many, Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each, mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll, half of the which dare not shake snow from off their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces. What shall be done to him? Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my condition, and what credit I have with the duke. Well, that's set down. Reads 'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain be i' the camp, a Frenchman, what his reputation is with the duke, what his valour, honesty, and expertness in wars, or whether he thinks it were not possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what do you know of it? I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories: demand them singly. Do you know this Captain Dumain? I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not say him nay. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands, though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.",Human
"Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp? Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy. Nay look not so upon me, we shall hear of your lordship anon. What is his reputation with the duke? The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine, and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket. Marry, we'll search. In good sadness, I do not know, either it is there, or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters in my tent. Here 'tis, here's a paper: shall I read it to you? I do not know if it be it or no. Our interpreter does it well. Excellently. [Reads]  'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'-- That is not the duke's letter, sir, that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again. Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour. My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid, for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds. Damnable both-sides rogue! [Reads]  'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it, After he scores, he never pays the score: Half won is match well made, match, and well make it, He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before, And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this, Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss: For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it, Who pays before, but not when he does owe it. Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear, PAROLLES.' He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in's forehead. This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier. I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now he's a cat to me. I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be fain to hang you. My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to die, but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the remainder of nature: let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.",Human
"We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely, therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour: what is his honesty? He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he professes not keeping of oaths, in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with such volubility, that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bed-clothes about him, but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has every thing that an honest man should not have, what an honest man should have, he has nothing. I begin to love him for this. For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him for me, he's more and more a cat. What say you to his expertness in war? Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English tragedians, to belie him, I will not, and more of his soldiership I know not, except, in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of this I am not certain. He hath out-villained villany so far, that the rarity redeems him. A pox on him, he's a cat still. His qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt. Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it, and cut the entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually. What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain? Why does be ask him of me? What's he? E'en a crow o' the same nest, not altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is: in a retreat he outruns any lackey, marry, in coming on he has the cramp. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine? Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon. I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure. [Aside]  I'll no more drumming, a plague of all",Human
"drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken? There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the general says, you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use, therefore you must die. Come, headsman, off with his head. O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death! That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends. Unblinding him So, look about you: know you any here? Good morrow, noble captain. God bless you, Captain Parolles. God save you, noble captain. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu? I am for France.

'Tis too late to pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves thrive long under her? There's a quart d'ecu for you: let the justices make you and fortune friends: I am for other business. I beseech your honour to hear me one single word. You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't, save your word. My name, my good lord, is Parolles. You beg more than 'word,' then. Cox my passion! give me your hand. How does your drum? O my good lord, you were the first that found me! Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring me out. Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once both the office of God and the devil? One brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out. Trumpets sound The king's coming, I know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me, I had talk of you last night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat, go to, follow.

"Was made much poorer by it: but your son, As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know Her estimation home. 'Tis past, my liege, And I beseech your majesty to make it Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth, When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force, O'erbears it and burns on. My honour'd lady, I have forgiven and forgotten all, Though my revenges were high bent upon him, And watch'd the time to shoot. This I must say, But first I beg my pardon, the young lord Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady Offence of mighty note, but to himself The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife Whose beauty did astonish the survey Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive, Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve Humbly call'd mistress. Praising what is lost Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither, We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill All repetition: let him not ask our pardon, The nature of his great offence is dead, And deeper than oblivion we do bury The incensing relics of it: let him approach, A stranger, no offender, and inform him So 'tis our will he should.

"Steals ere we can effect them. You remember The daughter of this lord? Admiringly, my liege, at first I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue Where the impression of mine eye infixing, Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me, Which warp'd the line of every other favour, Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen, Extended or contracted all proportions To a most hideous object: thence it came That she whom all men praised and whom myself, Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye The dust that did offend it. Well excused: That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away From the great compt: but love that comes too late, Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried, To the great sender turns a sour offence, Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults Make trivial price of serious things we have, Not knowing them until we know their grave: Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust, Destroy our friends and after weep their dust Our own love waking cries to see what's done, While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon. Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her. Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin: The main consents are had, and here we'll stay To see our widower's second marriage-day.

Hers it was not. Now, pray you, let me see it, for mine eye, While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't. This ring was mine, and, when I gave it Helen, I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood Necessitied to help, that by this token I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave her",Human
"Of what should stead her most? My gracious sovereign, Howe'er it pleases you to take it so, The ring was never hers. Son, on my life, I have seen her wear it, and she reckon'd it At her life's rate. I am sure I saw her wear it. You are deceived, my lord, she never saw it: In Florence was it from a casement thrown me, Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully I could not answer in that course of honour As she had made the overture, she ceased In heavy satisfaction and would never Receive the ring again. Plutus himself, That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine, Hath not in nature's mystery more science Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's, Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know That you are well acquainted with yourself, Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety That she would never put it from her finger, Unless she gave it to yourself in bed, Where you have never come, or sent it us Upon her great disaster. She never saw it. Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour, And makest conjectural fears to come into me Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so,-- And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly, And she is dead, which nothing, but to close Her eyes myself, could win me to believe, More than to see this ring.

Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour Than in my thought it lies. Good my lord, Ask him upon his oath, if he does think He had not my virginity. What say'st thou to her? She's impudent, my lord, And was a common gamester to the camp. He does me wrong, my lord, if I were so, He might have bought me at a common price: Do not believe him.

Enter ORLANDO and ADAM As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my",Human
"sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept, for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it. Yonder comes my master, your brother. Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up. Enter OLIVER Now, sir! what make you here? Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing. What mar you then, sir? Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness. Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile. Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them? What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should come to such penury? Know you where your are, sir? O, sir, very well, here in your orchard. Know you before whom, sir? Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother, and, in the gentle condition of blood, you should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that you are the first-born, but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit, I confess, your coming before me is nearer to his reverence. What, boy! Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this. Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain? I am no villain, I am the youngest son of Sir",Human
"Rowland de Boys, he was my father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself. Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's remembrance, be at accord. Let me go, I say. I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My father charged you in his will to give me good education: you have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament, with that I will go buy my fortunes. And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent? Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled with you, you shall have some part of your will: I pray you, leave me.

Exit DENNIS 'Twill be a good way, and to-morrow the wrestling is. Enter CHARLES Good morrow to your worship. Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the new court? There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news: that is, the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke, and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke, therefore he gives them good leave to wander. Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be banished with her father?",Human
"O, no, for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter, and never two ladies loved as they do. Where will the old duke live? They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him, and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world. What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke? Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall. To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well. Your brother is but young and tender, and, for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will. Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles: it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against me his natural brother: therefore use thy discretion, I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to't, for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other, for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one so young and so villanous this day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder. I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go",Human

Exit CHARLES Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see an end of him, for my soul, yet I know not why, hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprised: but it shall not be so long, this wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither, which now I'll go about. Exit SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace. Enter CELIA and ROSALIND I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry. Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure. Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to rejoice in yours. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee again in affection, by mine honour, I will, and when I break that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry. From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let me see, what think you of falling in love? Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but love no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again. What shall be our sport, then? Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally. I would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.",Human
"'Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly. Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of Nature. Enter TOUCHSTONE No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument? Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit. Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone, for always the dulness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now, wit! whither wander you? Mistress, you must come away to your father. Were you made the messenger? No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you. Where learned you that oath, fool? Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn. How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge? Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave. By our beards, if we had them, thou art. By my knavery, if I had it, then I were, but if you swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he never had any, or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard. Prithee, who is't that thou meanest? One that old Frederick, your father, loves. My father's love is enough to honour him: enough! speak no more of him, you'll be whipped for taxation one of these days. The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly. By my troth, thou sayest true, for since the little wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes",Human

Or as the Destinies decree. Well said: that was laid on with a trowel. Nay, if I keep not my rank,-- Thou losest thy old smell. You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of. You tell us the manner of the wrestling. I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to do, and here, where you are, they are coming to perform it. Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried. There comes an old man and his three sons,-- I could match this beginning with an old tale. Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence. With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men by these presents.' The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the duke's wrestler, which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him: so he served the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man, their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping. Alas! But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost? Why, this that I speak of. Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies. Or I, I promise thee. But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin? You must, if you stay here, for here is the place appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it. Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.",Human

Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully. How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither to see the wrestling? Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave. You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies, see if you can move him. Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau. Do so: I'll not be by. Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you. I attend them with all respect and duty. Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler? No, fair princess, he is the general challenger: I come but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth. Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt. Do, young sir, your reputation shall not therefore be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one shamed that was never gracious, if killed, but one dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the world no injury, for in it I have nothing, only in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when I have made it empty. The little strength that I have, I would it were with you. And mine, to eke out hers. Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you! Your heart's desires be with you! Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth? Ready, sir, but his will hath in it a more modest working.",Human
"You shall try but one fall. No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first. An you mean to mock me after, you should not have mocked me before: but come your ways. Now Hercules be thy speed, young man! I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the leg. They wrestle O excellent young man! If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should down. Shout. CHARLES is thrown No more, no more. Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed. How dost thou, Charles? He cannot speak, my lord. Bear him away. What is thy name, young man? Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys. I would thou hadst been son to some man else: The world esteem'd thy father honourable, But I did find him still mine enemy: Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed, Hadst thou descended from another house. But fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth: I would thou hadst told me of another father. Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU Were I my father, coz, would I do this? I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son, His youngest son, and would not change that calling, To be adopted heir to Frederick. My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul, And all the world was of my father's mind: Had I before known this young man his son, I should have given him tears unto entreaties, Ere he should thus have ventured. Gentle cousin, Let us go thank him and encourage him: My father's rough and envious disposition Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved: If you do keep your promises in love But justly, as you have exceeded all promise, Your mistress shall be happy. Gentleman, Giving him a chain from her neck Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune, That could give more, but that her hand lacks means. Shall we go, coz? Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.",Human
"Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block. He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes, I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir? Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown More than your enemies. Will you go, coz? Have with you. Fare you well. Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue? I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference. O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown! Or Charles or something weaker masters thee. Re-enter LE BEAU Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved High commendation, true applause and love, Yet such is now the duke's condition That he misconstrues all that you have done. The duke is humorous, what he is indeed, More suits you to conceive than I to speak of. I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this: Which of the two was daughter of the duke That here was at the wrestling? Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners, But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter The other is daughter to the banish'd duke, And here detain'd by her usurping uncle, To keep his daughter company, whose loves Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters. But I can tell you that of late this duke Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece, Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father's sake, And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well: Hereafter, in a better world than this, I shall desire more love and knowledge of you. I rest much bounden to you: fare you well. Exit LE BEAU Thus must I from the smoke into the smother, From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother: But heavenly Rosalind! Exit SCENE III. A room in the palace. Enter CELIA and ROSALIND Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word? Not one to throw at a dog.",Human
"No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs, throw some of them at me, come, lame me with reasons. Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any. But is all this for your father? No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how full of briers is this working-day world! They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them. I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart. Hem them away. I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him. Come, come, wrestle with thy affections. O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself! O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in good earnest: is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son? The duke my father loved his father dearly. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly, yet I hate not Orlando. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake. Why should I not? doth he not deserve well? Let me love him for that, and do you love him because I do. Look, here comes the duke. With his eyes full of anger. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste And get you from our court. Me, uncle? You, cousin Within these ten days if that thou be'st found So near our public court as twenty miles, Thou diest for it. I do beseech your grace, Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me: If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires, If that I do not dream or be not frantic,-- As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle, Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your highness. Thus do all traitors: If their purgation did consist in words, They are as innocent as grace itself:",Human
"Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor: Tell me whereon the likelihood depends. Thou art thy father's daughter, there's enough. So was I when your highness took his dukedom, So was I when your highness banish'd him: Treason is not inherited, my lord, Or, if we did derive it from our friends, What's that to me? my father was no traitor: Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous. Dear sovereign, hear me speak. Ay, Celia, we stay'd her for your sake, Else had she with her father ranged along. I did not then entreat to have her stay, It was your pleasure and your own remorse: I was too young that time to value her, But now I know her: if she be a traitor, Why so am I, we still have slept together, Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together, And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans, Still we went coupled and inseparable. She is too subtle for thee, and her smoothness, Her very silence and her patience Speak to the people, and they pity her. Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name, And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone. Then open not thy lips: Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have pass'd upon her, she is banish'd. Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege: I cannot live out of her company. You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself: If you outstay the time, upon mine honour, And in the greatness of my word, you die. Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go? Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine. I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am. I have more cause. Thou hast not, cousin, Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke Hath banish'd me, his daughter? That he hath not. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one: Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl? No: let my father seek another heir. Therefore devise with me how we may fly, Whither to go and what to bear with us,",Human
"And do not seek to take your change upon you, To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out, For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale, Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee. Why, whither shall we go? To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden. Alas, what danger will it be to us, Maids as we are, to travel forth so far! Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold. I'll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face, The like do you: so shall we pass along And never stir assailants. Were it not better, Because that I am more than common tall, That I did suit me all points like a man? A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh, A boar-spear in my hand, and--in my heart Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will-- We'll have a swashing and a martial outside, As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances. What shall I call thee when thou art a man? I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page, And therefore look you call me Ganymede. But what will you be call'd? Something that hath a reference to my state No longer Celia, but Aliena. But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal The clownish fool out of your father's court? Would he not be a comfort to our travel? He'll go along o'er the wide world with me, Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away, And get our jewels and our wealth together, Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight. Now go we in content To liberty and not to banishment. Exeunt ACT II SCENE I. The Forest of Arden. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords, like foresters Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile, Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court? Here feel we but the penalty of Adam, The seasons' difference, as the icy fang And churlish chiding of the winter's wind, Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,",Human
"Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say 'This is no flattery: these are counsellors That feelingly persuade me what I am.' Sweet are the uses of adversity, Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, Wears yet a precious jewel in his head, And this our life exempt from public haunt Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in stones and good in every thing. I would not change it. Happy is your grace, That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style. Come, shall we go and kill us venison? And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools, Being native burghers of this desert city, Should in their own confines with forked heads Have their round haunches gored. Indeed, my lord, The melancholy Jaques grieves at that, And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you. To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood: To the which place a poor sequester'd stag, That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt, Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting, and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase, and thus the hairy fool Much marked of the melancholy Jaques, Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook, Augmenting it with tears. But what said Jaques? Did he not moralize this spectacle? O, yes, into a thousand similes. First, for his weeping into the needless stream, 'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more To that which had too much:' then, being there alone, Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends, ''Tis right:' quoth he, 'thus misery doth part The flux of company:' anon a careless herd, Full of the pasture, jumps along by him And never stays to greet him, 'Ay' quoth Jaques, 'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens,",Human
"'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?' Thus most invectively he pierceth through The body of the country, city, court, Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse, To fright the animals and to kill them up In their assign'd and native dwelling-place. And did you leave him in this contemplation? We did, my lord, weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer. Show me the place: I love to cope him in these sullen fits, For then he's full of matter. I'll bring you to him straight. Exeunt SCENE II. A room in the palace. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords Can it be possible that no man saw them? It cannot be: some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this. I cannot hear of any that did see her. The ladies, her attendants of her chamber, Saw her abed, and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress. My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing. Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman, Confesses that she secretly o'erheard Your daughter and her cousin much commend The parts and graces of the wrestler That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles, And she believes, wherever they are gone, That youth is surely in their company. Send to his brother, fetch that gallant hither, If he be absent, bring his brother to me, I'll make him find him: do this suddenly, And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways. Exeunt SCENE III. Before OLIVER'S house. Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting Who's there? What, my young master? O, my gentle master! O my sweet master! O you memory Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here? Why are you virtuous? why do people love you? And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant? Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny priser of the humorous duke?",Human
"Your praise is come too swiftly home before you. Know you not, master, to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies? No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master, Are sanctified and holy traitors to you. O, what a world is this, when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it! Why, what's the matter? O unhappy youth! Come not within these doors, within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives: Your brother--no, no brother, yet the son-- Yet not the son, I will not call him son Of him I was about to call his father-- Hath heard your praises, and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie And you within it: if he fail of that, He will have other means to cut you off. I overheard him and his practises. This is no place, this house is but a butchery: Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it. Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go? No matter whither, so you come not here. What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food? Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road? This I must do, or know not what to do: Yet this I will not do, do how I can, I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother. But do not so. I have five hundred crowns, The thrifty hire I saved under your father, Which I did store to be my foster-nurse When service should in my old limbs lie lame And unregarded age in corners thrown: Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed, Yea, providently caters for the sparrow, Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold, And all this I give you. Let me be your servant: Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty, For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood, Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility, Therefore my age is as a lusty winter, Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you, I'll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities. O good old man, how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world,",Human
"When service sweat for duty, not for meed! Thou art not for the fashion of these times, Where none will sweat but for promotion, And having that, do choke their service up Even with the having: it is not so with thee. But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree, That cannot so much as a blossom yield In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry But come thy ways, well go along together, And ere we have thy youthful wages spent, We'll light upon some settled low content. Master, go on, and I will follow thee, To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty. From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here lived I, but now live here no more. At seventeen years many their fortunes seek, But at fourscore it is too late a week: Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well and not my master's debtor. Exeunt SCENE IV. The Forest of Arden. Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede, CELIA for Aliena, and TOUCHSTONE O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits! I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary. I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel and to cry like a woman, but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage, good Aliena! I pray you, bear with me, I cannot go no further. For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you, yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you, for I think you have no money in your purse. Well, this is the forest of Arden. Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I, when I was at home, I was in a better place: but travellers must be content. Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Enter CORIN and SILVIUS Look you, who comes here, a young man and an old in solemn talk. That is the way to make her scorn you still. O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her! I partly guess, for I have loved ere now. No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess, Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow: But if thy love were ever like to mine-- As sure I think did never man love so-- How many actions most ridiculous",Human
"Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy? Into a thousand that I have forgotten. O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily! If thou remember'st not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into, Thou hast not loved: Or if thou hast not sat as I do now, Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise, Thou hast not loved: Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly, as my passion now makes me, Thou hast not loved. O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe! Exit Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound, I have by hard adventure found mine own. And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile, and I remember the kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milked, and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are true lovers run into strange capers, but as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly. Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of. Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it. Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion Is much upon my fashion. And mine, but it grows something stale with me. I pray you, one of you question yond man If he for gold will give us any food: I faint almost to death. Holla, you clown! Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman. Who calls? Your betters, sir. Else are they very wretched. Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend. And to you, gentle sir, and to you all. I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment, Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed: Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd And faints for succor. Fair sir, I pity her And wish, for her sake more than for mine own, My fortunes were more able to relieve her,",Human
"But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze: My master is of churlish disposition And little recks to find the way to heaven By doing deeds of hospitality: Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now, By reason of his absence, there is nothing That you will feed on, but what is, come see. And in my voice most welcome shall you be. What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture? That young swain that you saw here but erewhile, That little cares for buying any thing. I pray thee, if it stand with honesty, Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock, And thou shalt have to pay for it of us. And we will mend thy wages. I like this place. And willingly could waste my time in it. Assuredly the thing is to be sold: Go with me: if you like upon report The soil, the profit and this kind of life, I will your very faithful feeder be And buy it with your gold right suddenly. Exeunt SCENE V. The Forest. Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and others SONG. Under the greenwood tree Who loves to lie with me, And turn his merry note Unto the sweet bird's throat, Come hither, come hither, come hither: Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough weather. More, more, I prithee, more. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more. My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you. I do not desire you to please me, I do desire you to sing. Come, more, another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos? What you will, Monsieur Jaques. Nay, I care not for their names, they owe me nothing. Will you sing? More at your request than to please myself. Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you, but that they call compliment is like the encounter of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me",Human
"the beggarly thanks. Come, sing, and you that will not, hold your tongues. Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while, the duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look you. And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is too disputable for my company: I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them. Come, warble, come. SONG. Who doth ambition shun All together here And loves to live i' the sun, Seeking the food he eats And pleased with what he gets, Come hither, come hither, come hither: Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough weather. I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention. And I'll sing it. Thus it goes:-- If it do come to pass That any man turn ass, Leaving his wealth and ease, A stubborn will to please, Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame: Here shall he see Gross fools as he, An if he will come to me. What's that 'ducdame'? 'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle. I'll go sleep, if I can, if I cannot, I'll rail against all the first-born of Egypt. And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared. Exeunt severally SCENE VI. The forest. Enter ORLANDO and ADAM Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master. Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live a little, comfort a little, cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers. For my sake be comfortable, hold death awhile at the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I",Human
"come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said! thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly. Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear thee to some shelter, and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this desert. Cheerly, good Adam! Exeunt SCENE VII. The forest. A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and Lords like outlaws I think he be transform'd into a beast, For I can no where find him like a man. My lord, he is but even now gone hence: Here was he merry, hearing of a song. If he, compact of jars, grow musical, We shall have shortly discord in the spheres. Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him. Enter JAQUES He saves my labour by his own approach. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this, That your poor friends must woo your company? What, you look merrily! A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest, A motley fool, a miserable world! As I do live by food, I met a fool Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun, And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms, In good set terms and yet a motley fool. 'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he, 'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:' And then he drew a dial from his poke, And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye, Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock: Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags: 'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, And after one hour more 'twill be eleven, And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe, And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot, And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear The motley fool thus moral on the time, My lungs began to crow like chanticleer, That fools should be so deep-contemplative, And I did laugh sans intermission An hour by his dial. O noble fool! A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear. What fool is this? O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier, And says, if ladies be but young and fair, They have the gift to know it: and in his brain, Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd",Human
"With observation, the which he vents In mangled forms. O that I were a fool! I am ambitious for a motley coat. Thou shalt have one. It is my only suit, Provided that you weed your better judgments Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise. I must have liberty Withal, as large a charter as the wind, To blow on whom I please, for so fools have, And they that are most galled with my folly, They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so? The 'why' is plain as way to parish church: He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly, although he smart, Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not, The wise man's folly is anatomized Even by the squandering glances of the fool. Invest me in my motley, give me leave To speak my mind, and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of the infected world, If they will patiently receive my medicine. Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do. What, for a counter, would I do but good? Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin: For thou thyself hast been a libertine, As sensual as the brutish sting itself, And all the embossed sores and headed evils, That thou with licence of free foot hast caught, Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world. Why, who cries out on pride, That can therein tax any private party? Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea, Till that the weary very means do ebb? What woman in the city do I name, When that I say the city-woman bears The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders? Who can come in and say that I mean her, When such a one as she such is her neighbour? Or what is he of basest function That says his bravery is not of my cost, Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits His folly to the mettle of my speech? There then, how then? what then? Let me see wherein My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right, Then he hath wrong'd himself, if he be free, Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies, Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here? Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn Forbear, and eat no more.",Human
"Why, I have eat none yet. Nor shalt not, till necessity be served. Of what kind should this cock come of? Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress, Or else a rude despiser of good manners, That in civility thou seem'st so empty? You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred And know some nurture. But forbear, I say: He dies that touches any of this fruit Till I and my affairs are answered. An you will not be answered with reason, I must die. What would you have? Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness. I almost die for food, and let me have it. Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you: I thought that all things had been savage here, And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are That in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of melancholy boughs, Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time If ever you have look'd on better days, If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church, If ever sat at any good man's feast, If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied, Let gentleness my strong enforcement be: In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword. True is it that we have seen better days, And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd: And therefore sit you down in gentleness And take upon command what help we have That to your wanting may be minister'd. Then but forbear your food a little while, Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn And give it food. There is an old poor man, Who after me hath many a weary step Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed, Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger, I will not touch a bit.

"This wide and universal theatre Presents more woeful pageants than the scene Wherein we play in. All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players: They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms. And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances, And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen, And let him feed. I thank you most for him. So had you need: I scarce can speak to thank you for myself. Welcome, fall to: I will not trouble you As yet, to question you about your fortunes. Give us some music, and, good cousin, sing. SONG. Blow, blow, thou winter wind. Thou art not so unkind As man's ingratitude, Thy tooth is not so keen, Because thou art not seen, Although thy breath be rude. Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly: Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly: Then, heigh-ho, the holly!",Human
"This life is most jolly. Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky, That dost not bite so nigh As benefits forgot: Though thou the waters warp, Thy sting is not so sharp As friend remember'd not. Heigh-ho! sing,  and c. If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son, As you have whisper'd faithfully you were, And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limn'd and living in your face, Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke That loved your father: the residue of your fortune, Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man, Thou art right welcome as thy master is. Support him by the arm. Give me your hand, And let me all your fortunes understand. Exeunt ACT III SCENE I. A room in the palace. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVER Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be: But were I not the better part made mercy, I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it: Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is, Seek him with candle, bring him dead or living Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory. Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure do we seize into our hands, Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth Of what we think against thee. O that your highness knew my heart in this! I never loved my brother in my life. More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors, And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands: Do this expediently and turn him going. Exeunt SCENE II. The forest. Enter ORLANDO, with a paper Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love: And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above, Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway. O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books And in their barks my thoughts I'll character, That every eye which in this forest looks",Human
"Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where. Run, run, Orlando, carve on every tree The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she. Exit Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone? Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well, but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well, but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well, but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd? No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is, and that he that wants money, means and content is without three good friends, that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn, that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun, that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd? No, truly. Then thou art damned. Nay, I hope. Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side. For not being at court? Your reason. Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest good manners, if thou never sawest good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd. Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court, but you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds. Instance, briefly, come, instance. Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say, come. Besides, our hands are hard.",Human
"Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance, come. And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are perfumed with civet. Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd. You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest. Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee! thou art raw. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck. That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle, to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not damned for this, the devil himself will have no shepherds, I cannot see else how thou shouldst 'scape. Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother. Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading From the east to western Ind, No jewel is like Rosalind. Her worth, being mounted on the wind, Through all the world bears Rosalind. All the pictures fairest lined Are but black to Rosalind. Let no fair be kept in mind But the fair of Rosalind. I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the right butter-women's rank to market. Out, fool! For a taste: If a hart do lack a hind, Let him seek out Rosalind. If the cat will after kind, So be sure will Rosalind. Winter garments must be lined, So must slender Rosalind. They that reap must sheaf and bind, Then to cart with Rosalind. Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,",Human
"Such a nut is Rosalind. He that sweetest rose will find Must find love's prick and Rosalind. This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you infect yourself with them? Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree. Truly, the tree yields bad fruit. I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit i' the country, for you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar. You have said, but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge. Enter CELIA, with a writing Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside. [Reads] Why should this a desert be? For it is unpeopled? No: Tongues I'll hang on every tree, That shall civil sayings show: Some, how brief the life of man Runs his erring pilgrimage, That the stretching of a span Buckles in his sum of age, Some, of violated vows 'Twixt the souls of friend and friend: But upon the fairest boughs, Or at every sentence end, Will I Rosalinda write, Teaching all that read to know The quintessence of every sprite Heaven would in little show. Therefore Heaven Nature charged That one body should be fill'd With all graces wide-enlarged: Nature presently distill'd Helen's cheek, but not her heart, Cleopatra's majesty, Atalanta's better part, Sad Lucretia's modesty. Thus Rosalind of many parts By heavenly synod was devised, Of many faces, eyes and hearts, To have the touches dearest prized. Heaven would that she these gifts should have, And I to live and die her slave. O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have patience, good people!' How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.",Human
"Go with him, sirrah. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat, though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage. Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE Didst thou hear these verses? O, yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear. That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses. Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees? I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came, for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly remember. Trow you who hath done this? Is it a man? And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck. Change you colour? I prithee, who? O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet, but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter. Nay, but who is it? Is it possible? Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is. O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that, out of all hooping! Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of delay more is a South-sea of discovery, I prithee, tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow- mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that may drink thy tidings. So you may put a man in your belly. Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard? Nay, he hath but a little beard. Why, God will send more, if the man will be thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.",Human
"It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's heels and your heart both in an instant. Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and true maid. I' faith, coz, 'tis he. Orlando? Orlando. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he? How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see him again? Answer me in one word. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism. But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled? It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover, but take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn. It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops forth such fruit. Give me audience, good madam. Proceed. There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight. Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground. Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee, it curvets unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter. O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart. I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest me out of tune. Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must speak. Sweet, say on. You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here? Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES 'Tis he: slink by, and note him. I thank you for your company, but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.

"them ill-favouredly. Rosalind is your love's name? Yes, just. I do not like her name. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened. What stature is she of? Just as high as my heart. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them out of rings? Not so, but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence you have studied your questions. You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against whom I know most faults. The worst fault you have is to be in love. 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am weary of you. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you. He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you shall see him. There I shall see mine own figure. Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher. I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good Signior Love. I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy. Exit JAQUES [Aside to CELIA]  I will speak to him, like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him. Do you hear, forester? Very well: what would you? I pray you, what is't o'clock? You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock in the forest. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock. And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that been as proper? By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops withal and who he stands still withal. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?",Human
"Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year. Who ambles Time withal? With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury, these Time ambles withal. Who doth he gallop withal? With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there. Who stays it still withal? With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves. Where dwell you, pretty youth? With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat. Are you native of this place? As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling. I have been told so of many: but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women? There were none principal, they were all like one another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it. I prithee, recount some of them. No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks, hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him. I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me your remedy. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he",Human
"taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner. What were his marks? A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected, which you have not, but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation, but you are no such man, you are rather point-device in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love. Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you love believe it, which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess she does: that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired? I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak? Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much. Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel. Did you ever cure any so? Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress, and I set him every day to woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every passion something and for no passion truly any thing, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour, would now like him, now loathe him, then entertain him, then forswear him, now weep for him, then spit at him, that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't. I would not be cured, youth.",Human
"I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me. Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me where it is. Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go? With all my heart, good youth. Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go? Exeunt SCENE III. The forest. Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY, JAQUES behind Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet? doth my simple feature content you? Your features! Lord warrant us! what features! I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths. [Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a thatched house! When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical. I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in deed and word? is it a true thing? No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign. Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical? I do, truly, for thou swearest to me thou art honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign. Would you not have me honest? No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured, for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar. [Aside]  A material fool! Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me honest. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness! sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village, who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us. [Aside]  I would fain see this meeting.",Human
"Well, the gods give us joy! Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt, for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of his goods:' right, many a man has good horns, and knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife, 'tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor, and by how much defence is better than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to want. Here comes Sir Oliver. Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel? Is there none here to give the woman? I will not take her on gift of any man. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful. [Advancing] Proceed, proceed	I'll give her. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you, sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your last company: I am very glad to see you: even a toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered. Will you be married, motley? As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires, and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is: this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot, then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp. [Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another: for he is not like to marry me well, and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee. 'Come, sweet Audrey: We must be married, or we must live in bawdry. Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,-- O sweet Oliver, O brave Oliver,",Human

As good cause as one would desire, therefore weep. His very hair is of the dissembling colour. Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are Judas's own children. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously, the very ice of chastity is in them. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not? Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him. Do you think so? Yes, I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut. Not true in love? Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in. You have heard him swear downright he was. 'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster, they are both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the duke your father. I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him: he asked me of what parentage I was, I told him, of as good as he, so he laughed and let me go. But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a man as Orlando? O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover, as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble",Human

But till that time Come not thou near me: and when that time comes, Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not, As till that time I shall not pity thee. And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother, That you insult, exult, and all at once, Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,-- As, by my faith, I see no more in you Than without candle may go dark to bed-- Must you be therefore proud and pitiless? Why, what means this? Why do you look on me? I see no more in you than in the ordinary Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life, I think she means to tangle my eyes too!

You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her, Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain? You are a thousand times a properer man Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children: 'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her, And out of you she sees herself more proper Than any of her lineaments can show her.

So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well. Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together: I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.

Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be: If you do sorrow at my grief in love, By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined. Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly? I would have you. Why, that were covetousness. Silvius, the time was that I hated thee, And yet it is not that I bear thee love, But since that thou canst talk of love so well, Thy company, which erst was irksome to me, I will endure, and I'll employ thee too: But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd. So holy and so perfect is my love, And I in such a poverty of grace, That I shall think it a most plenteous crop To glean the broken ears after the man That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon. Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile? Not very well, but I have met him oft, And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of. Think not I love him, though I ask for him: 'Tis but a peevish boy, yet he talks well, But what care I for words? yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear. It is a pretty youth: not very pretty: But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him: He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him Is his complexion, and faster than his tongue Did make offence his eye did heal it up. He is not very tall, yet for his years he's tall: His leg is but so so, and yet 'tis well: There was a pretty redness in his lip, A little riper and more lusty red Than that mix'd in his cheek, 'twas just the difference Between the constant red and mingled damask. There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him",Human
"In parcels as I did, would have gone near To fall in love with him, but, for my part, I love him not nor hate him not, and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him: For what had he to do to chide at me? He said mine eyes were black and my hair black: And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me: I marvel why I answer'd not again: But that's all one, omittance is no quittance. I'll write to him a very taunting letter, And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius? Phebe, with all my heart.

Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee. They say you are a melancholy fellow. I am so, I do love it better than laughing. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing. Why then, 'tis good to be a post. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical, nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's, which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor the lover's, which is all these: but it is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's contemplation of my travels, in which my often rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's, then, to have seen much and to have nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands. Yes, I have gained my experience. And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad, and to travel for it too! Enter ORLANDO Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind! Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.",Human
"Exit Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be out of love with your nativity and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant him heart-whole. Pardon me, dear Rosalind. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I had as lief be wooed of a snail. Of a snail? Ay, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head, a better jointure, I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings his destiny with him. What's that? Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife. Virtue is no horn-maker, and my Rosalind is virtuous. And I am your Rosalind. It pleases him to call you so, but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you. Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind? I would kiss before I spoke. Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravelled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit, and for lovers lacking--God warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss. How if the kiss be denied? Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress? Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit. What, of my suit? Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind? I take some joy to say you are, because I would be",Human
"talking of her. Well in her person I say I will not have you. Then in mine own person I die. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night, for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.' But these are all lies: men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them, but not for love. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for, I protest, her frown might kill me. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant it. Then love me, Rosalind. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all. And wilt thou have me? Ay, and twenty such. What sayest thou? Are you not good? I hope so. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us. Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister? Pray thee, marry us. I cannot say the words. You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--' Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind? I will. Ay, but when? Why now, as fast as she can marry us. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.' I take thee, Rosalind, for wife. I might ask you for your commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a woman's thought runs before her actions. So do all thoughts, they are winged. Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her. For ever and a day.",Human
"Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry, I will laugh like a hyen, and that when thou art inclined to sleep. But will my Rosalind do so? By my life, she will do as I do. O, but she is wise. Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's wit and it will out at the casement, shut that and 'twill out at the key-hole, stop that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit, whither wilt?' Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed. And what wit could wit have to excuse that? Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her answer, unless you take her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool! For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee. Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours. I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I will be with thee again. Ay, go your ways, go your ways, I knew what you would prove: my friends told me as much, and I thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come, death! Two o'clock is your hour? Ay, sweet Rosalind. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep your promise.

O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the bay of Portugal. Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out. No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love.

Patience herself would startle at this letter And play the swaggerer, bear this, bear all: She says I am not fair, that I lack manners, She calls me proud, and that she could not love me, Were man as rare as phoenix.

Come, come, you are a fool And turn'd into the extremity of love. I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand. A freestone-colour'd hand, I verily did think That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands: She has a huswife's hand, but that's no matter: I say she never did invent this letter, This is a man's invention and his hand. Sure, it is hers. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style. A style for-challengers, why, she defies me, Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter? So please you, for I never heard it yet, Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.

"This handkercher was stain'd. I pray you, tell it. When last the young Orlando parted from you He left a promise to return again Within an hour, and pacing through the forest, Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy, Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside, And mark what object did present itself: Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age And high top bald with dry antiquity, A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair, Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself, Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd The opening of his mouth, but suddenly, Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself, And with indented glides did slip away Into a bush: under which bush's shade A lioness, with udders all drawn dry, Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch, When that the sleeping man should stir, for 'tis The royal disposition of that beast To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead: This seen, Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother, his elder brother. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother, And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men. And well he might so do, For well I know he was unnatural. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there, Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness? Twice did he turn his back and purposed so, But kindness, nobler ever than revenge, And nature, stronger than his just occasion, Made him give battle to the lioness, Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling From miserable slumber I awaked. Are you his brother? Wast you he rescued? Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound, And, after some small space, being strong at heart, He sent me hither, stranger as I am, To tell this story, that you might excuse His broken promise, and to give this napkin Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.

If again 'it was not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie Circumstantial and the Lie Direct. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut? I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct, and so we measured swords and parted. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie? O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners: I will name you the degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous, the second, the Quip Modest, the third, the Reply Churlish, the fourth, the Reproof Valiant, the fifth, the Countercheque Quarrelsome, the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance, the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct, and you may avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so,' and they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the only peacemaker, much virtue in If. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at any thing and yet a fool. He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest, Address'd a mighty power, which were on foot, In his own conduct, purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword: And to the skirts of this wild wood he came, Where meeting with an old religious man, After some question with him, was converted Both from his enterprise and from the world, His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother, And all their lands restored to them again That were with him exiled. This to be true,",Human
"I do engage my life. Welcome, young man, Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding: To one his lands withheld, and to the other A land itself at large, a potent dukedom. First, in this forest, let us do those ends That here were well begun and well begot: And after, every of this happy number That have endured shrewd days and nights with us Shall share the good of our returned fortune, According to the measure of their states. Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity And fall into our rustic revelry. Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all, With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall. Sir, by your patience.

To him will I : out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.

Nay, hear them, Antony: Fulvia perchance is angry, or, who knows If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this, Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that, Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'

Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space. Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life Is to do thus, when such a mutual pair Embracing And such a twain can do't, in which I bind, On pain of punishment, the world to weet We stand up peerless. Excellent falsehood! Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her? I'll seem the fool I am not, Antony Will be himself. But stirr'd by Cleopatra. Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours, Let's not confound the time with conference harsh: There's not a minute of our lives should stretch Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight? Hear the ambassadors. Fie, wrangling queen! Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh, To weep, whose every passion fully strives To make itself, in thee, fair and admired! No messenger, but thine, and all alone To-night we'll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people. Come, my queen, Last night you did desire it: speak not to us. Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with their train Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?

Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all: let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress. You shall outlive the lady whom you serve. O excellent! I love long life better than figs. You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune Than that which is to approach. Then belike my children shall have no names: prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have? If every of your wishes had a womb. And fertile every wish, a million. Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch. You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes. Nay, come, tell Iras hers. We'll know all our fortunes.

Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight, good Isis, I beseech thee! Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!

O, then we bring forth weeds, When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile. At your noble pleasure. Exit From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!

Exit Second Messenger There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it: What our contempt doth often hurl from us, We wish it ours again, the present pleasure, By revolution lowering, does become The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone, The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on. I must from this enchanting queen break off: Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know, My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus! Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS What's your pleasure, sir? I must with haste from hence. Why, then, we kill all our women: we see how mortal an unkindness is to them, if they suffer our departure, death's the word. I must be gone.

She is cunning past man's thought. Exit ALEXAS Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears, they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this cannot be cunning in her, if it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove. Would I had never seen her. O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel. Fulvia is dead. Sir? Fulvia is dead. Fulvia! Dead. Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth, comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned with consolation, your old smock brings forth a new petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow. The business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absence. And the business you have broached here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your abode. No more light answers. Let our officers Have notice what we purpose.

I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,-- Help me away, dear Charmian, I shall fall: It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature Will not sustain it. Now, my dearest queen,-- Pray you, stand further from me. What's the matter? I know, by that same eye, there's some good news. What says the married woman? You may go: Would she had never given you leave to come! Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here: I have no power upon you, hers you are. The gods best know,-- O, never was there queen So mightily betray'd! yet at the first I saw the treasons planted.

Riotous madness, To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,",Human
"Which break themselves in swearing! Most sweet queen,-- Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going, But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying, Then was the time for words: no going then, Eternity was in our lips and eyes, Bliss in our brows' bent, none our parts so poor, But was a race of heaven: they are so still, Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world, Art turn'd the greatest liar. How now, lady! I would I had thy inches, thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt. Hear me, queen: The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile, but my full heart Remains in use with you. Our Italy Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius Makes his approaches to the port of Rome: Equality of two domestic powers Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength, Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey, Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace, Into the hearts of such as have not thrived Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten, And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge By any desperate change: my more particular, And that which most with you should safe my going, Is Fulvia's death. Though age from folly could not give me freedom, It does from childishness: can Fulvia die? She's dead, my queen: Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read The garboils she awaked, at the last, best: See when and where she died. O most false love! Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see, In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be. Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know The purposes I bear, which are, or cease, As you shall give the advice. By the fire That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war As thou affect'st.

Look, prithee, Charmian, How this Herculean Roman does become The carriage of his chafe. I'll leave you, lady. Courteous lord, one word. Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it: Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it, That you know well: something it is I would, O, my oblivion is a very Antony, And I am all forgotten. But that your royalty Holds idleness your subject, I should take you For idleness itself. 'Tis sweating labour To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me, Since my becomings kill me, when they do not Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence, Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly. And all the gods go with you! upon your sword Sit laurel victory! and smooth success Be strew'd before your feet! Let us go.

"I must not think there are Evils enow to darken all his goodness: His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven, More fiery by night's blackness, hereditary, Rather than purchased, what he cannot change, Than what he chooses. You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy, To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit And keep the turn of tippling with a slave, To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet With knaves that smell of sweat: say this becomes him,-- As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony No way excuse his soils, when we do bear So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd His vacancy with his voluptuousness, Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones, Call on him for't: but to confound such time, That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge, Pawn their experience to their present pleasure, And so rebel to judgment. Enter a Messenger Here's more news. Thy biddings have been done, and every hour, Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea, And it appears he is beloved of those That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports The discontents repair, and men's reports Give him much wrong'd. I should have known no less. It hath been taught us from the primal state, That he which is was wish'd until he were, And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love, Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body, Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream, Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide, To rot itself with motion. Caesar, I bring thee word, Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates, Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound With keels of every kind: many hot inroads They make in Italy, the borders maritime Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt: No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon Taken as seen, for Pompey's name strikes more",Human
"Than could his war resisted. Antony, Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel Did famine follow, whom thou fought'st against, Though daintily brought up, with patience more Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign The roughest berry on the rudest hedge, Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets, The barks of trees thou browsed'st, on the Alps It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh, Which some did die to look on: and all this-- It wounds thine honour that I speak it now-- Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek So much as lank'd not. 'Tis pity of him. Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain Did show ourselves i' the field, and to that end Assemble we immediate council: Pompey Thrives in our idleness. To-morrow, Caesar, I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time. Till which encounter, It is my business too. Farewell. Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir, To let me be partaker. Doubt not, sir, I knew it for my bond. Exeunt SCENE V. Alexandria.

You think of him too much. O, 'tis treason! Madam, I trust, not so. Thou, eunuch Mardian! What's your highness' pleasure?",Human
"Not now to hear thee sing, I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee, That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections? Yes, gracious madam. Indeed! Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing But what indeed is honest to be done: Yet have I fierce affections, and think What Venus did with Mars. O Charmian, Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he? Or does he walk? or is he on his horse? O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony! Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest? The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm And burgonet of men. He's speaking now, Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?' For so he calls me: now I feed myself With most delicious poison. Think on me, That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black, And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar, When thou wast here above the ground, I was A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow, There would he anchor his aspect and die With looking on his life. Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR Sovereign of Egypt, hail! How much unlike art thou Mark Antony! Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath With his tinct gilded thee. How goes it with my brave Mark Antony? Last thing he did, dear queen, He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,-- This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart. Mine ear must pluck it thence. 'Good friend,' quoth he, 'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends This treasure of an oyster, at whose foot, To mend the petty present, I will piece Her opulent throne with kingdoms, all the east, Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded, And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed, Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumb'd by him. What, was he sad or merry? Like to the time o' the year between the extremes Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry. O well-divided disposition! Note him,",Human
"Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man, but note him: He was not sad, for he would shine on those That make their looks by his, he was not merry, Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy, but between both: O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry, The violence of either thee becomes, So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts? Ay, madam, twenty several messengers: Why do you send so thick? Who's born that day When I forget to send to Antony, Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian. Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian, Ever love Caesar so? O that brave Caesar! Be choked with such another emphasis! Say, the brave Antony. The valiant Caesar! By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth, If thou with Caesar paragon again My man of men. By your most gracious pardon, I sing but after you. My salad days, When I was green in judgment: cold in blood, To say as I said then!

Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays The thing we sue for. We, ignorant of ourselves, Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers Deny us for our good, so find we profit By losing of our prayers. I shall do well: The people love me, and the sea is mine, My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where",Human
"He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both, Of both is flatter'd, but he neither loves, Nor either cares for him. Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry. Where have you this? 'tis false. From Silvius, sir. He dreams: I know they are in Rome together, Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love, Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip! Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both! Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts, Keep his brain fuming, Epicurean cooks Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite, That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour Even till a Lethe'd dulness! Enter VARRIUS How now, Varrius! This is most certain that I shall deliver: Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis A space for further travel. I could have given less matter A better ear. Menas, I did not think This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm For such a petty war: his soldiership Is twice the other twain: but let us rear The higher our opinion, that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony. I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together: His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar, His brother warr'd upon him, although, I think, Not moved by Antony. I know not, Menas, How lesser enmities may give way to greater. Were't not that we stand up against them all, 'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves, For they have entertained cause enough To draw their swords: but how the fear of us May cement their divisions and bind up The petty difference, we yet not know. Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands. Come, Menas. Exeunt SCENE II. Rome. The house of LEPIDUS. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS",Human
"Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed, And shall become you well, to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech. I shall entreat him To answer like himself: if Caesar move him, Let Antony look over Caesar's head And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter, Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard, I would not shave't to-day. 'Tis not a time For private stomaching. Every time Serves for the matter that is then born in't. But small to greater matters must give way. Not if the small come first. Your speech is passion: But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes The noble Antony. Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS And yonder, Caesar. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA If we compose well here, to Parthia: Hark, Ventidius. I do not know, Mecaenas, ask Agrippa. Noble friends, That which combined us was most great, and let not A leaner action rend us. What's amiss, May it be gently heard: when we debate Our trivial difference loud, we do commit Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners, The rather, for I earnestly beseech, Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms, Nor curstness grow to the matter. 'Tis spoken well. Were we before our armies, and to fight. I should do thus. Flourish Welcome to Rome. Thank you. Sit. Sit, sir. Nay, then. I learn, you take things ill which are not so, Or being, concern you not. I must be laugh'd at, If, or for nothing or a little, I Should say myself offended, and with you Chiefly i' the world, more laugh'd at, that I should Once name you derogately, when to sound your name",Human
"It not concern'd me. My being in Egypt, Caesar, What was't to you? No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt Might be my question. How intend you, practised? You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother Made wars upon me, and their contestation Was theme for you, you were the word of war. You do mistake your business, my brother never Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it, And have my learning from some true reports, That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours, And make the wars alike against my stomach, Having alike your cause? Of this my letters Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel, As matter whole you have not to make it with, It must not be with this. You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me, but You patch'd up your excuses. Not so, not so, I know you could not lack, I am certain on't, Very necessity of this thought, that I, Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought, Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife, I would you had her spirit in such another: The third o' the world is yours, which with a snaffle You may pace easy, but not such a wife. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to wars with the women! So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar Made out of her impatience, which not wanted Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant Did you too much disquiet: for that you must But say, I could not help it. I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria, you Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts Did gibe my missive out of audience. Sir, He fell upon me ere admitted: then Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want Of what I was i' the morning: but next day I told him of myself, which was as much",Human
"As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow Be nothing of our strife, if we contend, Out of our question wipe him. You have broken The article of your oath, which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with. Soft, Caesar! No, Lepidus, let him speak: The honour is sacred which he talks on now, Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar, The article of my oath. To lend me arms and aid when I required them, The which you both denied. Neglected, rather, And then when poison'd hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may, I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia, To have me out of Egypt, made wars here, For which myself, the ignorant motive, do So far ask pardon as befits mine honour To stoop in such a case. 'Tis noble spoken. If it might please you, to enforce no further The griefs between ye: to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you. Worthily spoken, Mecaenas. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do. Thou art a soldier only: speak no more. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot. You wrong this presence, therefore speak no more. Go to, then, your considerate stone. I do not much dislike the matter, but The manner of his speech, for't cannot be We shall remain in friendship, our conditions So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge O' the world I would pursue it. Give me leave, Caesar,-- Speak, Agrippa. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side, Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony Is now a widower. Say not so, Agrippa:",Human
"If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof Were well deserved of rashness. I am not married, Caesar: let me hear Agrippa further speak. To hold you in perpetual amity, To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts With an unslipping  knot, take Antony Octavia to his wife, whose beauty claims No worse a husband than the best of men, Whose virtue and whose general graces speak That which none else can utter. By this marriage, All little jealousies, which now seem great, And all great fears, which now import their dangers, Would then be nothing: truths would be tales, Where now half tales be truths: her love to both Would, each to other and all loves to both, Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke, For 'tis a studied, not a present thought, By duty ruminated. Will Caesar speak? Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd With what is spoke already. What power is in Agrippa, If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,' To make this good? The power of Caesar, and His power unto Octavia. May I never To this good purpose, that so fairly shows, Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand: Further this act of grace: and from this hour The heart of brothers govern in our loves And sway our great designs! There is my hand. A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother Did ever love so dearly: let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts, and never Fly off our loves again! Happily, amen! I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey, For he hath laid strange courtesies and great Of late upon me: I must thank him only, Lest my remembrance suffer ill report, At heel of that, defy him. Time calls upon's: Of us must Pompey presently be sought, Or else he seeks out us. Where lies he? About the mount Misenum. What is his strength by land?",Human
"Great and increasing: but by sea He is an absolute master. So is the fame. Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it: Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we The business we have talk'd of. With most gladness: And do invite you to my sister's view, Whither straight I'll lead you. Let us, Lepidus, Not lack your company. Noble Antony, Not sickness should detain me. Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, and LEPIDUS Welcome from Egypt, sir. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My honourable friend, Agrippa! Good Enobarbus! We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt. Ay, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance, and made the night light with drinking. Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons there, is this true? This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her. When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up his heart, upon the river of Cydnus. There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised well for her. I will tell you. The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne, Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold, Purple the sails, and so perfumed that The winds were love-sick with them, the oars were silver, Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made The water which they beat to follow faster, As amorous of their strokes. For her own person, It beggar'd all description: she did lie In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue-- O'er-picturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature: on each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, And what they undid did. O, rare for Antony! Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,",Human
"So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes, And made their bends adornings: at the helm A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands, That yarely frame the office. From the barge A strange invisible perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast Her people out upon her, and Antony, Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone, Whistling to the air, which, but for vacancy, Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too, And made a gap in nature. Rare Egyptian! Upon her landing, Antony sent to her, Invited her to supper: she replied, It should be better he became her guest, Which she entreated: our courteous Antony, Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak, Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast, And for his ordinary pays his heart For what his eyes eat only. Royal wench! She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed: He plough'd her, and she cropp'd. I saw her once Hop forty paces through the public street, And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted, That she did make defect perfection, And, breathless, power breathe forth. Now Antony must leave her utterly. Never, he will not: Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale Her infinite variety: other women cloy The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies, for vilest things Become themselves in her: that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle The heart of Antony, Octavia is A blessed lottery to him. Let us go. Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here. Humbly, sir, I thank you.

Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA Enter Soothsayer Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt? Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither! If you can, your reason? I see it in My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet Hie you to Egypt again. Say to me, Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine? Caesar's. Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side: Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is Noble, courageous high, unmatchable, Where Caesar's is not, but, near him, thy angel Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore Make space enough between you. Speak this no more. To none but thee, no more, but when to thee. If thou dost play with him at any game, Thou art sure to lose, and, of that natural luck, He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens, When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit Is all afraid to govern thee near him, But, he away, 'tis noble. Get thee gone: Say to Ventidius I would speak with him: Exit Soothsayer He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap, He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him, And in our sports my better cunning faints Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds, His cocks do win the battle still of mine, When it is all to nought, and his quails ever Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds.

I'll none now: Give me mine angle, we'll to the river: there, My music playing far off, I will betray Tawny-finn'd fishes, my bended hook shall pierce Their slimy jaws, and, as I draw them up, I'll think them every one an Antony, And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.' 'Twas merry when You wager'd on your angling, when your diver Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he With fervency drew up.

First, madam, he is well. Why, there's more gold. But, sirrah, mark, we use To say the dead are well: bring it to that, The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill-uttering throat. Good madam, hear me. Well, go to, I will, But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour To trumpet such good tidings! If not well, Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes, Not like a formal man. Will't please you hear me?

Prithee, friend, Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear, The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar: In state of health thou say'st, and thou say'st free. Free, madam! no, I made no such report: He's bound unto Octavia. For what good turn? For the best turn i' the bed. I am pale, Charmian. Madam, he's married to Octavia.

At land, indeed, Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house: But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself, Remain in't as thou mayst. Be pleased to tell us-- For this is from the present--how you take The offers we have sent you. There's the point. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh What it is worth embraced.

That's our offer. Know, then, I came before you here a man prepared To take this offer: but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience: though I lose The praise of it by telling, you must know, When Caesar and your brother were at blows, Your mother came to Sicily and did find Her welcome friendly. I have heard it, Pompey, And am well studied for a liberal thanks Which I do owe you. Let me have your hand: I did not think, sir, to have met you here. The beds i' the east are soft, and thanks to you, That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither, For I have gain'd by 't. Since I saw you last, There is a change upon you.

I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there. You have heard much. I have fair meanings, sir. And fair words to them. Then so much have I heard: And I have heard, Apollodorus carried-- No more of that: he did so. What, I pray you? A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress. I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier? Well, And well am like to do, for, I perceive, Four feasts are toward. Let me shake thy hand, I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight, When I have envied thy behavior.

But there is never a fair woman has a true face. No slander, they steal hearts. We came hither to fight with you. For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune. If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again. You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra? Caesar's sister is called Octavia. True, sir, she was the wife of Caius Marcellus. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius. Pray ye, sir? 'Tis true. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties. I think so too. But you shall find, the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation. Who would not have his wife so? Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is: he married but his occasion here. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you.

You've strange serpents there. Ay, Lepidus. Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun: so is your crocodile. They are so. Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus! I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out. Not till you have slept, I fear me you'll be in till then. Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things, without contradiction, I have heard that. [Aside to POMPEY]  Pompey, a word.

This wine for Lepidus! What manner o' thing is your crocodile? It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is, and moves with its own organs: it lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements once out of it, it transmigrates. What colour is it of? Of it own colour too. 'Tis a strange serpent. 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet. Will this description satisfy him?

Wilt thou be lord of all the world? What say'st thou? Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice. How should that be? But entertain it, And, though thou think me poor, I am the man Will give thee all the world. Hast thou drunk well? Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup. Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove: Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips, Is thine, if thou wilt ha't. Show me which way. These three world-sharers, these competitors, Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable, And, when we are put off, fall to their throats: All there is thine. Ah, this thou shouldst have done, And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany, In thee't had been good service. Thou must know, 'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour, Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown, I should have found it afterwards well done, But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink. [Aside]  For this, I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more. Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd, Shall never find it more. This health to Lepidus! Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey. Here's to thee, Menas! Enobarbus, welcome! Fill till the cup be hid. There's a strong fellow, Menas. Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS Why?

Noble Ventidius, Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm, The fugitive Parthians follow, spur through Media, Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and Put garlands on thy head. O Silius, Silius, I have done enough, a lower place, note well, May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius, Better to leave undone, than by our deed Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away. Caesar and Antony have ever won More in their officer than person: Sossius, One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant, For quick accumulation of renown, Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour. Who does i' the wars more than his captain can Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition, The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss, Than gain which darkens him. I could do more to do Antonius good, But 'twould offend him, and in his offence Should my performance perish. Thou hast, Ventidius, that Without the which a soldier, and his sword, Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!

Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony! Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter. Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil! O Antony! O thou Arabian bird! Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises. But he loves Caesar best, yet he loves Antony: Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho! His love to Antony.

[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  Why, Enobarbus, When Antony found Julius Caesar dead, He cried almost to roaring, and he wept When at Philippi he found Brutus slain. [Aside to AGRIPPA]  That year, indeed, he was troubled with a rheum, What willingly he did confound he wail'd, Believe't, till I wept too. No, sweet Octavia, You shall hear from me still, the time shall not Out-go my thinking on you.

O, is't come to this? I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar's trencher, nay, you were a fragment Of Cneius Pompey's, besides what hotter hours, Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure, Though you can guess what temperance should be, You know not what it is. Wherefore is this? To let a fellow that will take rewards And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal And plighter of high hearts!

Now my spirit is going, I can no more. Noblest of men, woo't die? Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide In this dull world, which in thy absence is No better than a sty? O, see, my women, MARK ANTONY dies The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord! O, wither'd is the garland of the war, The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls Are level now with men, the odds is gone, And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon. Faints O, quietness, lady! She is dead too, our sovereign. Lady! Madam! O madam, madam, madam! Royal Egypt, Empress! Peace, peace, Iras! No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares. It were for me To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods, To tell them that this world did equal theirs Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught, Patience is scottish, and impatience does Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin To rush into the secret house of death, Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women? What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian! My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look, Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart: We'll bury him, and then, what's brave, what's noble,",Human
"Let's do it after the high Roman fashion, And make death proud to take us. Come, away: This case of that huge spirit now is cold: Ah, women, women! come, we have no friend But resolution, and the briefest end. Exeunt, those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body ACT V SCENE I. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield, Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks The pauses that he makes. Caesar, I shall. Exit Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest Appear thus to us? I am call'd Dercetas, Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke, He was my master, and I wore my life To spend upon his haters. If thou please To take me to thee, as I was to him I'll be to Caesar, if thou pleasest not, I yield thee up my life. What is't thou say'st? I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead. The breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack: the round world Should have shook lions into civil streets, And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony Is not a single doom, in the name lay A moiety of the world. He is dead, Caesar: Not by a public minister of justice, Nor by a hired knife, but that self hand, Which writ his honour in the acts it did, Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it, Splitted the heart. This is his sword, I robb'd his wound of it, behold it stain'd With his most noble blood. Look you sad, friends? The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings. And strange it is, That nature must compel us to lament Our most persisted deeds. His taints and honours Waged equal with him. A rarer spirit never",Human
"Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd. When such a spacious mirror's set before him, He needs must see himself. O Antony! I have follow'd thee to this, but we do lance Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce Have shown to thee such a declining day, Or look on thine, we could not stall together In the whole world: but yet let me lament, With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts, That thou, my brother, my competitor In top of all design, my mate in empire, Friend and companion in the front of war, The arm of mine own body, and the heart Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars, Unreconciliable, should divide Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-- But I will tell you at some meeter season: Enter an Egyptian The business of this man looks out of him, We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you? A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress, Confined in all she has, her monument, Of thy intents desires instruction, That she preparedly may frame herself To the way she's forced to. Bid her have good heart: She soon shall know of us, by some of ours, How honourable and how kindly we Determine for her, for Caesar cannot live To be ungentle. So the gods preserve thee! Exit Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say, We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts The quality of her passion shall require, Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke She do defeat us, for her life in Rome Would be eternal in our triumph: go, And with your speediest bring us what she says, And how you find of her. Caesar, I shall. Exit Gallus, go you along. Exit GALLUS Where's Dolabella, To second Proculeius? Dolabella! Let him alone, for I remember now",Human
"How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready. Go with me to my tent, where you shall see How hardly I was drawn into this war, How calm and gentle I proceeded still In all my writings: go with me, and see What I can show in this. Exeunt SCENE II. Alexandria. A room in the monument. Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS My desolation does begin to make A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar, Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave, A minister of her will: and it is great To do that thing that ends all other deeds, Which shackles accidents and bolts up change, Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug, The beggar's nurse and Caesar's. Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS and Soldiers Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt, And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean'st to have him grant thee. What's thy name? My name is Proculeius. Antony Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but I do not greatly care to be deceived, That have no use for trusting. If your master Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him, That majesty, to keep decorum, must No less beg than a kingdom: if he please To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son, He gives me so much of mine own, as I Will kneel to him with thanks. Be of good cheer, You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing: Make your full reference freely to my lord, Who is so full of grace, that it flows over On all that need: let me report to him Your sweet dependency, and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness, Where he for grace is kneel'd to. Pray you, tell him I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him The greatness he has got. I hourly learn A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly Look him i' the face. This I'll report, dear lady.

Cleopatra, Do not abuse my master's bounty by The undoing of yourself: let the world see His nobleness well acted, which your death Will never let come forth. Where art thou, death? Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen Worthy many babes and beggars! O, temperance, lady! Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir, If idle talk will once be necessary, I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin, Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court, Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies Blow me into abhorring! rather make My country's high pyramides my gibbet, And hang me up in chains! You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar. Enter DOLABELLA Proculeius, What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows, And he hath sent for thee: for the queen, I'll take her to my guard.

"Say, I would die. Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers Most noble empress, you have heard of me? I cannot tell. Assuredly you know me. No matter, sir, what I have heard or known. You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams, Is't not your trick? I understand not, madam. I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony: O, such another sleep, that I might see But such another man! If it might please ye,-- His face was as the heavens, and therein stuck A sun and moon, which kept their course, and lighted The little O, the earth. Most sovereign creature,-- His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm Crested the world: his voice was propertied As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends, But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty, There was no winter in't, an autumn 'twas That grew the more by reaping: his delights Were dolphin-like, they show'd his back above The element they lived in: in his livery Walk'd crowns and crownets, realms and islands were As plates dropp'd from his pocket. Cleopatra! Think you there was, or might be, such a man As this I dream'd of? Gentle madam, no. You lie, up to the hearing of the gods. But, if there be, or ever were, one such, It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy, yet, to imagine And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy, Condemning shadows quite. Hear me, good madam. Your loss is as yourself, great, and you bear it As answering to the weight: would I might never O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel, By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites My very heart at root. I thank you, sir, Know you what Caesar means to do with me? I am loath to tell you what I would you knew. Nay, pray you, sir,-- Though he be honourable,--",Human

Take to you no hard thoughts: The record of what injuries you did us, Though written in our flesh, we shall remember As things but done by chance. Sole sir o' the world, I cannot project mine own cause so well To make it clear, but do confess I have Been laden with like frailties which before Have often shamed our sex. Cleopatra, know, We will extenuate rather than enforce: If you apply yourself to our intents, Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find A benefit in this change, but if you seek To lay on me a cruelty, by taking Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself Of my good purposes, and put your children To that destruction which I'll guard them from, If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave. And may, through all the world: 'tis yours, and we, Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord. You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra. This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels, I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued, Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus? Here, madam. This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord, Upon his peril, that I have reserved To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus. Madam, I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril, Speak that which is not. What have I kept back? Enough to purchase what you have made known.

What, goest thou back? thou shalt Go back, I warrant thee, but I'll catch thine eyes, Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog! O rarely base! Good queen, let us entreat you. O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this, That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me, Doing the honour of thy lordliness To one so meek, that mine own servant should Parcel the sum of my disgraces by Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar, That I some lady trifles have reserved, Immoment toys, things of such dignity As we greet modern friends withal, and say, Some nobler token I have kept apart For Livia and Octavia, to induce Their mediation, must I be unfolded With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me Beneath the fall I have. To SELEUCUS Prithee, go hence, Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man, Thou wouldst have mercy on me. Forbear, Seleucus. Exit SELEUCUS Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought For things that others do, and, when we fall, We answer others' merits in our name, Are therefore to be pitied. Cleopatra, Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged, Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours, Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe, Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd, Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen, For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel.

For, since the mortal and intestine jars 'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us, It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves, To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more, If any born at Ephesus be seen At any Syracusian marts and fairs, Again: if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies, His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,",Human
"Unless a thousand marks be levied, To quit the penalty and to ransom him. Thy substance, valued at the highest rate, Cannot amount unto a hundred marks, Therefore by law thou art condemned to die. Yet this my comfort: when your words are done, My woes end likewise with the evening sun. Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause Why thou departed'st from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus. A heavier task could not have been imposed Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable: Yet, that the world may witness that my end Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence, I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave. In Syracusa was I born, and wed Unto a woman, happy but for me, And by me, had not our hap been bad. With her I lived in joy, our wealth increased By prosperous voyages I often made To Epidamnum, till my factor's death And the great care of goods at random left Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse: From whom my absence was not six months old Before herself, almost at fainting under The pleasing punishment that women bear, Had made provision for her following me And soon and safe arrived where I was. There had she not been long, but she became A joyful mother of two goodly sons, And, which was strange, the one so like the other, As could not be distinguish'd but by names. That very hour, and in the self-same inn, A meaner woman was delivered Of such a burden, male twins, both alike: Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,-- I bought and brought up to attend my sons. My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys, Made daily motions for our home return: Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon, We came aboard. A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd, Before the always wind-obeying deep Gave any tragic instance of our harm: But longer did we not retain much hope, For what obscured light the heavens did grant Did but convey unto our fearful minds A doubtful warrant of immediate death, Which though myself would gladly have embraced, Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,",Human
"Weeping before for what she saw must come, And piteous plainings of the pretty babes, That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear, Forced me to seek delays for them and me. And this it was, for other means was none: The sailors sought for safety by our boat, And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us: My wife, more careful for the latter-born, Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast, Such as seafaring men provide for storms, To him one of the other twins was bound, Whilst I had been like heedful of the other: The children thus disposed, my wife and I, Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd, Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast, And floating straight, obedient to the stream, Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought. At length the sun, gazing upon the earth, Dispersed those vapours that offended us, And by the benefit of his wished light, The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered Two ships from far making amain to us, Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this: But ere they came,--O, let me say no more! Gather the sequel by that went before. Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so, For we may pity, though not pardon thee. O, had the gods done so, I had not now Worthily term'd them merciless to us! For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues, We were encounterd by a mighty rock, Which being violently borne upon, Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst, So that, in this unjust divorce of us, Fortune had left to both of us alike What to delight in, what to sorrow for. Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened With lesser weight but not with lesser woe, Was carried with more speed before the wind, And in our sight they three were taken up By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought. At length, another ship had seized on us, And, knowing whom it was their hap to save, Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests, And would have reft the fishers of their prey, Had not their bark been very slow of sail, And therefore homeward did they bend their course. Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss, That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd, To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.",Human
"And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for, Do me the favour to dilate at full What hath befall'n of them and thee till now. My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care, At eighteen years became inquisitive After his brother: and importuned me That his attendant--so his case was like, Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name-- Might bear him company in the quest of him: Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see, I hazarded the loss of whom I loved. Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece, Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia, And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus, Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbours men. But here must end the story of my life, And happy were I in my timely death, Could all my travels warrant me they live. Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd To bear the extremity of dire mishap! Now, trust me, were it not against our laws, Against my crown, my oath, my dignity, Which princes, would they, may not disannul, My soul would sue as advocate for thee. But, though thou art adjudged to the death And passed sentence may not be recall'd But to our honour's great disparagement, Yet I will favour thee in what I can. Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day To seek thy life by beneficial help: Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus, Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum, And live, if no, then thou art doom'd to die. Gaoler, take him to thy custody. I will, my lord. Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend, But to procrastinate his lifeless end. Exeunt SCENE II. The Mart.

I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner: I from my mistress come to you in post, If I return, I shall be post indeed, For she will score your fault upon my pate. Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock, And strike you home without a messenger. ANTIPHOLUS Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season, Reserve them till a merrier hour than this. Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee? To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me. ANTIPHOLUS Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness, And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge. My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner: My mistress and her sister stays for you. ANTIPHOLUS In what safe place you have bestow'd my money, Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours That stands on tricks when I am undisposed: Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me? I have some marks of yours upon my pate, Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders, But not a thousand marks between you both. If I should pay your worship those again, Perchance you will not bear them patiently. ANTIPHOLUS Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou? Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix, She that doth fast till you come home to dinner, And prays that you will hie you home to dinner. ANTIPHOLUS What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face, Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave. What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands! Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels. Exit ANTIPHOLUS",Human
"Upon my life, by some device or other The villain is o'er-raught of all my money. They say this town is full of cozenage, As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye, Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind, Soul-killing witches that deform the body, Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks, And many such-like liberties of sin: If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner. I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave: I greatly fear my money is not safe. Exit ACT II SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus. Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA Neither my husband nor the slave return'd, That in such haste I sent to seek his master! Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock. Perhaps some merchant hath invited him, And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner. Good sister, let us dine and never fret: A man is master of his liberty: Time is their master, and, when they see time, They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister. Why should their liberty than ours be more? Because their business still lies out o' door. Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill. O, know he is the bridle of your will. There's none but asses will be bridled so. Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe. There's nothing situate under heaven's eye But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky: The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls, Are their males' subjects and at their controls: Men, more divine, the masters of all these, Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas, Indued with intellectual sense and souls, Of more preeminence than fish and fowls, Are masters to their females, and their lords: Then let your will attend on their accords. This servitude makes you to keep unwed. Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed. But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway. Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey. How if your husband start some other where? Till he come home again, I would forbear. Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause, They can be meek that have no other cause. A wretched soul, bruised with adversity, We bid be quiet when we hear it cry,",Human
"But were we burdened with like weight of pain, As much or more would we ourselves complain: So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee, With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me, But, if thou live to see like right bereft, This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left. Well, I will marry one day, but to try. Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh. Enter DROMIO of Ephesus Say, is your tardy master now at hand? Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears can witness. Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind? Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear: Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it. Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning? Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his blows, and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand them. But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he hath great care to please his wife. Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad. Horn-mad, thou villain! I mean not cuckold-mad, But, sure, he is stark mad. When I desired him to come home to dinner, He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold: ''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I, 'My gold!' quoth he, 'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I, 'My gold!' quoth he: 'Will you come home?' quoth I, 'My gold!' quoth he. 'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?' 'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd,' 'My gold!' quoth he: 'My mistress, sir' quoth I, 'Hang up thy mistress! I know not thy mistress, out on thy mistress!' Quoth who? Quoth my master: 'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.' So that my errand, due unto my tongue, I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders, For, in conclusion, he did beat me there. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home. Go back again, and be new beaten home? For God's sake, send some other messenger. Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across. And he will bless that cross with other beating: Between you I shall have a holy head. Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home. Am I so round with you as you with me, That like a football you do spurn me thus? You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:",Human
"If I last in this service, you must case me in leather. Exit Fie, how impatience loureth in your face! His company must do his minions grace, Whilst I at home starve for a merry look. Hath homely age the alluring beauty took From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it: Are my discourses dull? barren my wit? If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd, Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard: Do their gay vestments his affections bait? That's not my fault: he's master of my state: What ruins are in me that can be found, By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground Of my defeatures. My decayed fair A sunny look of his would soon repair But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale And feeds from home, poor I am but his stale. Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence! Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense. I know his eye doth homage otherwhere, Or else what lets it but he would be here? Sister, you know he promised me a chain, Would that alone, alone he would detain, So he would keep fair quarter with his bed! I see the jewel best enamelled Will lose his beauty, yet the gold bides still, That others touch, and often touching will Wear gold: and no man that hath a name, By falsehood and corruption doth it shame. Since that my beauty cannot please his eye, I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die. How many fond fools serve mad jealousy! Exeunt SCENE II. A public place. Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse ANTIPHOLUS The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out By computation and mine host's report. I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes. Enter DROMIO of Syracuse How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd? As you love strokes, so jest with me again. You know no Centaur? you received no gold? Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner? My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad, That thus so madly thou didst answer me?",Human
"What answer, sir? when spake I such a word? ANTIPHOLUS Even now, even here, not half an hour since. I did not see you since you sent me hence, Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me. ANTIPHOLUS Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt, And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner, For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased. I am glad to see you in this merry vein: What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me. ANTIPHOLUS Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth? Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that. Beating him Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest: Upon what bargain do you give it me? ANTIPHOLUS Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you, Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours. When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport, But creep in crannies when he hides his beams. If you will jest with me, know my aspect, And fashion your demeanor to my looks, Or I will beat this method in your sconce. Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I had rather have it a head: an you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce it too, or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But, I pray, sir why am I beaten? ANTIPHOLUS Dost thou not know? Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten. ANTIPHOLUS Shall I tell you why? Ay, sir, and wherefore, for they say every why hath a wherefore. ANTIPHOLUS Why, first,--for flouting me, and then, wherefore-- For urging it the second time to me. Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season, When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason? Well, sir, I thank you. ANTIPHOLUS Thank me, sir, for what? Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing. ANTIPHOLUS",Human
"I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time? No, sir, I think the meat wants that I have. ANTIPHOLUS In good time, sir, what's that? Basting. ANTIPHOLUS Well, sir, then 'twill be dry. If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it. ANTIPHOLUS Your reason? Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting. ANTIPHOLUS Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a time for all things. I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric. ANTIPHOLUS By what rule, sir? Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father Time himself. ANTIPHOLUS Let's hear it. There's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature. ANTIPHOLUS May he not do it by fine and recovery? Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man. ANTIPHOLUS Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement? Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit. ANTIPHOLUS Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit. Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair. ANTIPHOLUS Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit. The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity. ANTIPHOLUS For what reason? For two, and sound ones too. ANTIPHOLUS Nay, not sound, I pray you. Sure ones, then. ANTIPHOLUS Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing. Certain ones then.",Human
"ANTIPHOLUS Name them. The one, to save the money that he spends in trimming, the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge. ANTIPHOLUS You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things. Marry, and did, sir, namely, no time to recover hair lost by nature. ANTIPHOLUS But your reason was not substantial, why there is no time to recover. Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers. ANTIPHOLUS I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion: But, soft! who wafts us yonder? Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown: Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects, I am not Adriana nor thy wife. The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear, That never object pleasing in thine eye, That never touch well welcome to thy hand, That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste, Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee. How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it, That thou art thus estranged from thyself? Thyself I call it, being strange to me, That, undividable, incorporate, Am better than thy dear self's better part. Ah, do not tear away thyself from me! For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall A drop of water in the breaking gulf, And take unmingled that same drop again, Without addition or diminishing, As take from me thyself and not me too. How dearly would it touch me to the quick, Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious And that this body, consecrate to thee, By ruffian lust should be contaminate! Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me And hurl the name of husband in my face And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring And break it with a deep-divorcing vow? I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it. I am possess'd with an adulterate blot,",Human

Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed, I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured. ANTIPHOLUS Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not: In Ephesus I am but two hours old, As strange unto your town as to your talk, Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd, Want wit in all one word to understand. Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you! When were you wont to use my sister thus? She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner. ANTIPHOLUS By Dromio? By me? By thee, and this thou didst return from him, That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows, Denied my house for his, me for his wife. ANTIPHOLUS Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman? What is the course and drift of your compact? I, sir? I never saw her till this time. ANTIPHOLUS Villain, thou liest, for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart. I never spake with her in all my life. ANTIPHOLUS How can she thus then call us by our names, Unless it be by inspiration. How ill agrees it with your gravity To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave, Abetting him to thwart me in my mood! Be it my wrong you are from me exempt, But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt. Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine: Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine, Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state, Makes me with thy strength to communicate: If aught possess thee from me, it is dross, Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss, Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.

Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not? Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot! I am transformed, master, am I not? ANTIPHOLUS I think thou art in mind, and so am I. Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape. ANTIPHOLUS Thou hast thine own form. No, I am an ape. If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass. 'Tis true, she rides me and I long for grass. 'Tis so, I am an ass, else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows me.

Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks. Sirrah, if any ask you for your master, Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter. Come, sister.

"He met me on the mart, and that I beat him, And charged him with a thousand marks in gold, And that I did deny my wife and house. Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this? Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know, That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show: If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink, Your own handwriting would tell you what I think. ANTIPHOLUS I think thou art an ass. Marry, so it doth appear By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear. I should kick, being kick'd, and, being at that pass, You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass. ANTIPHOLUS You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer May answer my good will and your good welcome here. I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear. ANTIPHOLUS O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish, A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish. Good meat, sir, is common, that every churl affords. ANTIPHOLUS And welcome more common, for that's nothing but words. Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast. ANTIPHOLUS Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest: But though my cates be mean, take them in good part, Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart. But, soft! my door is lock'd.

If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would fain have either. In debating which was best, we shall part with neither. They stand at the door, master, bid them welcome hither. ANTIPHOLUS There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in. You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.

Master, mean you so? For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather, If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together. ANTIPHOLUS Go get thee gone, fetch me an iron crow. Have patience, sir, O, let it not be so! Herein you war against your reputation And draw within the compass of suspect The unviolated honour of your wife. Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom, Her sober virtue, years and modesty, Plead on her part some cause to you unknown: And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse Why at this time the doors are made against you. Be ruled by me: depart in patience, And let us to the Tiger all to dinner, And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint. If by strong hand you offer to break in Now in the stirring passage of the day, A vulgar comment will be made of it, And that supposed by the common rout Against your yet ungalled estimation That may with foul intrusion enter in And dwell upon your grave when you are dead, For slander lives upon succession, For ever housed where it gets possession. ANTIPHOLUS You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet, And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry. I know a wench of excellent discourse, Pretty and witty, wild, and yet, too, gentle: There will we dine.

Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your horse, and she would have me as a beast: not that, I being a beast, she would have me, but that she, being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me. ANTIPHOLUS What is she? A very reverent body, ay, such a one as a man may not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage. ANTIPHOLUS How dost thou mean a fat marriage? Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease, and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday, she'll burn a week longer than the whole world. ANTIPHOLUS What complexion is she of? Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so clean kept: for why, she sweats, a man may go over shoes in the grime of it. ANTIPHOLUS That's a fault that water will mend. No, sir, 'tis in grain, Noah's flood could not do it. ANTIPHOLUS What's her name? Nell, sir, but her name and three quarters, that's an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from hip to hip.

I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no whiteness in them, but I guess it stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it. ANTIPHOLUS Where Spain? Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in her breath. ANTIPHOLUS Where America, the Indies? Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain, who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose. ANTIPHOLUS Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands? Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me Dromio, swore I was assured to her, told me what privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch: And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith and my heart of steel, She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made me turn i' the wheel.

I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine: The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long. ANTIPHOLUS What is your will that I shall do with this? What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you. ANTIPHOLUS Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not. Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have. Go home with it and please your wife withal, And soon at supper-time I'll visit you And then receive my money for the chain. ANTIPHOLUS I pray you, sir, receive the money now, For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more. You are a merry man, sir: fare you well. Exit ANTIPHOLUS What I should think of this, I cannot tell: But this I think, there's no man is so vain That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.

Belike you thought our love would last too long, If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not. Saving your merry humour, here's the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat, The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion. Which doth amount to three odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman: I pray you, see him presently discharged, For he is bound to sea and stays but for it. ANTIPHOLUS I am not furnish'd with the present money, Besides, I have some business in the town. Good signior, take the stranger to my house And with you take the chain and bid my wife Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof: Perchance I will be there as soon as you. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself? ANTIPHOLUS No, bear it with you, lest I come not time enough. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you? ANTIPHOLUS An if I have not, sir, I hope you have, Or else you may return without your money. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain: Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman, And I, to blame, have held him here too long. ANTIPHOLUS Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine. I should have chid you for not bringing it, But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl. The hour steals on, I pray you, sir, dispatch. You hear how he importunes me,--the chain! ANTIPHOLUS Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now. Either send the chain or send me by some token. ANTIPHOLUS",Human

Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no: If not, I'll leave him to the officer. ANTIPHOLUS I answer you! what should I answer you? The money that you owe me for the chain. ANTIPHOLUS I owe you none till I receive the chain. You know I gave it you half an hour since. ANTIPHOLUS You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it: Consider how it stands upon my credit. Well, officer, arrest him at my suit. I do, and charge you in the duke's name to obey me. This touches me in reputation. Either consent to pay this sum for me Or I attach you by this officer. ANTIPHOLUS Consent to pay thee that I never had! Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest. Here is thy fee, arrest him, officer, I would not spare my brother in this case, If he should scorn me so apparently. I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.

Why, thou peevish sheep, What ship of Epidamnum stays for me? A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.

What observation madest thou in this case Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face? First he denied you had in him no right. He meant he did me none, the more my spite. Then swore he that he was a stranger here. And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were. Then pleaded I for you. And what said he? That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me. With what persuasion did he tempt thy love? With words that in an honest suit might move. First he did praise my beauty, then my speech. Didst speak him fair? Have patience, I beseech. I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still, My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will. He is deformed, crooked, old and sere, Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere, Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind, Stigmatical in making, worse in mind. Who would be jealous then of such a one? No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone. Ah, but I think him better than I say, And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.

No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell. A devil in an everlasting garment hath him, One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel, A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough, A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff, A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands, A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well, One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell. Why, man, what is the matter? I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case. What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit. I know not at whose suit he is arrested well, But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell. Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk? Go fetch it, sister. Exit Luciana This I wonder at, That he, unknown to me, should be in debt. Tell me, was he arrested on a band? Not on a band, but on a stronger thing, A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring? What, the chain? No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone: It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one. The hours come back! that did I never hear. O, yes, if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for very fear. As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason! Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's worth, to season.

Sure, these are but imaginary wiles And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here. Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled? ANTIPHOLUS What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean? Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's skin that was killed for the Prodigal, he that came behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty. ANTIPHOLUS I understand thee not. No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a bass-viol, in a case of leather, the man, sir, that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob and 'rests them, he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance, he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.

ANTIPHOLUS It is the devil. Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof comes that the wenches say 'God damn me,' that's as much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is written, they appear to men like angels of light: light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn, ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her. Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir. Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here? Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat, or bespeak a long spoon. ANTIPHOLUS Why, Dromio? Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil. ANTIPHOLUS Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping? Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress: I conjure thee to leave me and be gone. Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner, Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised, And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you. Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail, A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin, A nut, a cherry-stone, But she, more covetous, would have a chain.

A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats, And for the same he promised me a chain: Both one and other he denies me now.

Let us come in, that we may bind him fast And bear him home for his recovery. I knew he was not in his perfect wits. I am sorry now that I did draw on him. How long hath this possession held the man? This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad, And much different from the man he was, But till this afternoon his passion Ne'er brake into extremity of rage. Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea? Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye Stray'd his affection in unlawful love? A sin prevailing much in youthful men, Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing. Which of these sorrows is he subject to? To none of these, except it be the last, Namely, some love that drew him oft from home. You should for that have reprehended him. Why, so I did. Ay, but not rough enough. As roughly as my modesty would let me. Haply, in private. And in assemblies too. Ay, but not enough. It was the copy of our conference: In bed he slept not for my urging it, At board he fed not for my urging it, Alone, it was the subject of my theme, In company I often glanced it, Still did I tell him it was vile and bad. And thereof came it that the man was mad. The venom clamours of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth. It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing, And therefore comes it that his head is light. Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings: Unquiet meals make ill digestions, Thereof the raging fire of fever bred, And what's a fever but a fit of madness? Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls: Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue But moody and dull melancholy, Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair, And at her heels a huge infectious troop",Human
"Of pale distemperatures and foes to life? In food, in sport and life-preserving rest To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast: The consequence is then thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits. She never reprehended him but mildly, When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly. Why bear you these rebukes and answer not? She did betray me to my own reproof. Good people enter and lay hold on him. No, not a creature enters in my house. Then let your servants bring my husband forth. Neither: he took this place for sanctuary, And it shall privilege him from your hands Till I have brought him to his wits again, Or lose my labour in assaying it. I will attend my husband, be his nurse, Diet his sickness, for it is my office, And will have no attorney but myself, And therefore let me have him home with me. Be patient, for I will not let him stir Till I have used the approved means I have, With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers, To make of him a formal man again: It is a branch and parcel of mine oath, A charitable duty of my order. Therefore depart and leave him here with me. I will not hence and leave my husband here: And ill it doth beseem your holiness To separate the husband and the wife. Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him. Exit Complain unto the duke of this indignity. Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the abbess.

She is a virtuous and a reverend lady: It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong. May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband, Whom I made lord of me and all I had, At your important letters,--this ill day A most outrageous fit of madness took him, That desperately he hurried through the street, With him his bondman, all as mad as he-- Doing displeasure to the citizens By rushing in their houses, bearing thence Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like. Once did I get him bound and sent him home, Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went, That here and there his fury had committed. Anon, I wot not by what strong escape, He broke from those that had the guard of him, And with his mad attendant and himself, Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords, Met us again and madly bent on us, Chased us away, till, raising of more aid, We came again to bind them. Then they fled Into this abbey, whither we pursued them: And here the abbess shuts the gates on us And will not suffer us to fetch him out, Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.

She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife, That hath abused and dishonour'd me Even in the strength and height of injury! Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me. Discover how, and thou shalt find me just. ANTIPHOLUS This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me, While she with harlots feasted in my house. A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so? No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister To-day did dine together. So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal! Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night, But she tells to your highness simple truth! O perjured woman! They are both forsworn: In this the madman justly chargeth them. ANTIPHOLUS My liege, I am advised what I say, Neither disturbed with the effect of wine, Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire, Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad. This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner: That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her, Could witness it, for he was with me then, Who parted with me to go fetch a chain, Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,",Human
"Where Balthazar and I did dine together. Our dinner done, and he not coming thither, I went to seek him: in the street I met him And in his company that gentleman. There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down That I this day of him received the chain, Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which He did arrest me with an officer. I did obey, and sent my peasant home For certain ducats: he with none return'd Then fairly I bespoke the officer To go in person with me to my house. By the way we met My wife, her sister, and a rabble more Of vile confederates. Along with them They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain, A mere anatomy, a mountebank, A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller, A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch, A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave, Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer, And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse, And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me, Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence And in a dark and dankish vault at home There left me and my man, both bound together, Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder, I gain'd my freedom, and immediately Ran hither to your grace, whom I beseech To give me ample satisfaction For these deep shames and great indignities. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him, That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out. But had he such a chain of thee or no? He had, my lord: and when he ran in here, These people saw the chain about his neck. Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine Heard you confess you had the chain of him After you first forswore it on the mart: And thereupon I drew my sword on you, And then you fled into this abbey here, From whence, I think, you are come by miracle. ANTIPHOLUS I never came within these abbey-walls, Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me: I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven! And this is false you burden me withal. Why, what an intricate impeach is this! I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.",Human
"If here you housed him, here he would have been, If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly: You say he dined at home, the goldsmith here Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you? Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine. He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring. ANTIPHOLUS 'Tis true, my liege, this ring I had of her. Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here? As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace. Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither. I think you are all mated or stark mad. Exit one to Abbess Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word: Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me. Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt. Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus? And is not that your bondman, Dromio? Within this hour I was his bondman sir, But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords: Now am I Dromio and his man unbound. I am sure you both of you remember me. Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you, For lately we were bound, as you are now You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir? Why look you strange on me? you know me well. I never saw you in my life till now. O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last, And careful hours with time's deformed hand Have written strange defeatures in my face: But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice? ANTIPHOLUS Neither. Dromio, nor thou? No, trust me, sir, nor I. I am sure thou dost. Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not, and whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him. Not know my voice! O time's extremity, Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years, that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares? Though now this grained face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow, And all the conduits of my blood froze up, Yet hath my night of life some memory, My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left, My dull deaf ears a little use to hear: All these old witnesses--I cannot err--",Human
"Tell me thou art my son Antipholus. ANTIPHOLUS I never saw my father in my life. But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy, Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son, Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery. ANTIPHOLUS The duke and all that know me in the city Can witness with me that it is not so I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life. I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years Have I been patron to Antipholus, During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa: I see thy age and dangers make thee dote. Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd. All gather to see them I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me. One of these men is Genius to the other, And so of these. Which is the natural man, And which the spirit? who deciphers them? I, sir, am Dromio, command him away. I, sir, am Dromio, pray, let me stay. ANTIPHOLUS AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost? O, my old master! who hath bound him here? Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds And gain a husband by his liberty. Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia That bore thee at a burden two fair sons: O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak, And speak unto the same AEmilia! If I dream not, thou art AEmilia: If thou art she, tell me where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft? By men of Epidamnum he and I And the twin Dromio all were taken up, But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth By force took Dromio and my son from them And me they left with those of Epidamnum. What then became of them I cannot tell I to this fortune that you see me in. Why, here begins his morning story right, These two Antipholuses, these two so like, And these two Dromios, one in semblance,-- Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,-- These are the parents to these children, Which accidentally are met together. Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?",Human
"ANTIPHOLUS No, sir, not I, I came from Syracuse. Stay, stand apart, I know not which is which. ANTIPHOLUS I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,-- And I with him. ANTIPHOLUS Brought to this town by that most famous warrior, Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle. Which of you two did dine with me to-day? ANTIPHOLUS I, gentle mistress. And are not you my husband? ANTIPHOLUS No, I say nay to that. ANTIPHOLUS And so do I, yet did she call me so: And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here, Did call me brother. To Luciana What I told you then, I hope I shall have leisure to make good, If this be not a dream I see and hear. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me. ANTIPHOLUS I think it be, sir, I deny it not. ANTIPHOLUS And you, sir, for this chain arrested me. I think I did, sir, I deny it not. I sent you money, sir, to be your bail, By Dromio, but I think he brought it not. No, none by me. ANTIPHOLUS This purse of ducats I received from you, And Dromio, my man, did bring them me. I see we still did meet each other's man, And I was ta'en for him, and he for me, And thereupon these errors are arose. ANTIPHOLUS These ducats pawn I for my father here. It shall not need, thy father hath his life. Sir, I must have that diamond from you. ANTIPHOLUS There, take it, and much thanks for my good cheer. Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes: And all that are assembled in this place, That by this sympathized one day's error Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,",Human
"And we shall make full satisfaction. Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you, my sons, and till this present hour My heavy burden ne'er delivered. The duke, my husband and my children both, And you the calendars of their nativity, Go to a gossips' feast and go with me, After so long grief, such festivity! With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast. Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus of Ephesus, Dromio of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard? ANTIPHOLUS Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd? Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur. ANTIPHOLUS He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio: Come, go with us, we'll look to that anon: Embrace thy brother there, rejoice with him. Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus There is a fat friend at your master's house, That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner: She now shall be my sister, not my wife. Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother: I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth. Will you walk in to see their gossiping? Not I, sir, you are my elder. That's a question: how shall we try it? We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first. Nay, then, thus: We came into the world like brother and brother, And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another. Exeunt ACT I SCENE I. Rome. A street. Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons Before we proceed any further, hear me speak. Speak, speak. You are all resolved rather to die than to famish? Resolved. resolved. First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people. We know't, we know't. Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price. Is't a verdict? No more talking on't, let it be done: away, away! One word, good citizens. We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they would yield us but the superfluity, while it were wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely, but they think we are too dear: the leanness that",Human
"afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an inventory to particularise their abundance, our sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge. Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius? Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty. Consider you what services he has done for his country? Very well, and could be content to give him good report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud. Nay, but speak not maliciously. I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud, which he is, even till the altitude of his virtue. What he cannot help in his nature, you account a vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous. If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations, he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition. Shouts within What shouts are these? The other side o' the city is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol! Come, come. Soft! who comes here? Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA Worthy Menenius Agrippa, one that hath always loved the people. He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so! What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you. Our business is not unknown to the senate, they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we have strong arms too. Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours, Will you undo yourselves? We cannot, sir, we are undone already. I tell you, friends, most charitable care Have the patricians of you. For your wants, Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them Against the Roman state, whose course will on The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs Of more strong link asunder than can ever Appear in your impediment. For the dearth, The gods, not the patricians, make it, and Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack, You are transported by calamity",Human
"Thither where more attends you, and you slander The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers, When you curse them as enemies. Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses crammed with grain, make edicts for usury, to support usurers, repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will, and there's all the love they bear us. Either you must Confess yourselves wondrous malicious, Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it, But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture To stale 't a little more. Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please you, deliver. There was a time when all the body's members Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it: That only like a gulf it did remain I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive, Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel, And, mutually participate, did minister Unto the appetite and affection common Of the whole body. The belly answer'd-- Well, sir, what answer made the belly? Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile, Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus-- For, look you, I may make the belly smile As well as speak--it tauntingly replied To the discontented members, the mutinous parts That envied his receipt, even so most fitly As you malign our senators for that They are not such as you. Your belly's answer? What! The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye, The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier, Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter. With other muniments and petty helps In this our fabric, if that they-- What then? 'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then? Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd, Who is the sink o' the body,-- Well, what then?",Human
"The former agents, if they did complain, What could the belly answer? I will tell you If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little-- Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer. Ye're long about it. Note me this, good friend, Your most grave belly was deliberate, Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd: 'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he, 'That I receive the general food at first, Which you do live upon, and fit it is, Because I am the store-house and the shop Of the whole body: but, if you do remember, I send it through the rivers of your blood, Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain, And, through the cranks and offices of man, The strongest nerves and small inferior veins From me receive that natural competency Whereby they live: and though that all at once, You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,-- Ay, sir, well, well. 'Though all at once cannot See what I do deliver out to each, Yet I can make my audit up, that all From me do back receive the flour of all, And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't? It was an answer: how apply you this? The senators of Rome are this good belly, And you the mutinous members, for examine Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find No public benefit which you receive But it proceeds or comes from them to you And no way from yourselves. What do you think, You, the great toe of this assembly? I the great toe! why the great toe? For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest, Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost: Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run, Lead'st first to win some vantage. But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs: Rome and her rats are at the point of battle, The one side must have bale. Enter CAIUS MARCIUS Hail, noble Marcius! Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, Make yourselves scabs? We have ever your good word.",Human
"He that will give good words to thee will flatter Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs, That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you, The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you, Where he should find you lions, finds you hares, Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no, Than is the coal of fire upon the ice, Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is To make him worthy whose offence subdues him And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness Deserves your hate, and your affections are A sick man's appetite, who desires most that Which would increase his evil. He that depends Upon your favours swims with fins of lead And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye? With every minute you do change a mind, And call him noble that was now your hate, Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter, That in these several places of the city You cry against the noble senate, who, Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else Would feed on one another? What's their seeking? For corn at their own rates, whereof, they say, The city is well stored. Hang 'em! They say! They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know What's done i' the Capitol, who's like to rise, Who thrives and who declines, side factions and give out Conjectural marriages, making parties strong And feebling such as stand not in their liking Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough! Would the nobility lay aside their ruth, And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high As I could pick my lance. Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded, For though abundantly they lack discretion, Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you, What says the other troop? They are dissolved: hang 'em! They said they were an-hungry, sigh'd forth proverbs, That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat, That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds They vented their complainings, which being answer'd, And a petition granted them, a strange one-- To break the heart of generosity,",Human

Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods. Be-mock the modest moon. The present wars devour him: he is grown Too proud to be so valiant. Such a nature, Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder His insolence can brook to be commanded Under Cominius. Fame, at the which he aims, In whom already he's well graced, can not Better be held nor more attain'd than by A place below the first: for what miscarries Shall be the general's fault, though he perform To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he Had borne the business!' Besides, if things go well, Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall Of his demerits rob Cominius. Come: Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.

Then his good report should have been my son, I therein would have found issue.
